#### EDITION

Einstein’s Theory of Relativity has advanced our ideas of the
structure of the cosmos a step further. It is as if a wall which separated us from Truth has collapsed. Wider expanses and greater
depths are now exposed to the searching eye of knowledge, regions
of which we had not even a presentiment. It has brought us much
nearer to grasping the plan that underlies all physical happening.
Although very recently a whole series of more or less popular
introductions into the general theory of relativity has appeared,
nevertheless a systematic presentation was lacking. I therefore
considered it appropriate to publish the following lectures which
I gave in the Summer Term of 1917 at the Eidgen. Technische
_Hochschule in Zürich. At the same time it was my wish to present_
this great subject as an illustration of the intermingling of philosophical, mathematical, and physical thought, a study which is
dear to my heart. This could be done only by building up the
theory systematically from the foundations, and by restricting attention throughout to the principles. But I have not been able to
satisfy these self-imposed requirements: the mathematician predominates at the expense of the philosopher.
The theoretical equipment demanded of the reader at the outset is a minimum. Not only is the special theory of relativity dealt
with exhaustively, but even Maxwell’s theory and analytical geometry are developed in their main essentials. This was a part
of the whole scheme. The setting up of the Tensor Calculus—by
means of which, alone, it is possible to express adequately the
physical knowledge under discussion—occupies a relatively large

students and win their sympathy for the new ideas.

#### PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

Although this book offers fruits of knowledge in a refractory shell, yet communications that have reached me have shown
that to some it has been a source of comfort in troublous times.
To gaze up from the ruins of the oppressive present towards the
stars is to recognise the indestructible world of laws, to strengthen
faith in reason, to realise the “harmonia mundi” that transfuses
all phenomena, and that never has been, nor will be, disturbed.
My endeavour in this third edition has been to attune this harmony more perfectly. Whereas the second edition was a reprint
of the first, I have now undertaken a thorough revision which affects Chapters II and IV above all. The discovery by Levi-Civita,
in 1917, of the conception of infinitesimal parallel displacements
suggested a renewed examination of the mathematical foundation
of Riemann’s geometry. The development of pure infinitesimal
geometry in Chapter II, in which every step follows quite naturally, clearly, and necessarily, from the preceding one, is, I believe,
the final result of this investigation as far as the essentials are
concerned. Several shortcomings that were present in my first
account in the Mathematische Zeitschrift (Bd 2 1918) have now


-----

stein’s Theory of Gravitation has, in consideration of the various
important works that have appeared in the meanwhile, in particular those that refer to the Principle of Energy-Momentum, been
subjected to a very considerable revision. Furthermore, a new
theory by the author has been added, which draws the physical
inferences consequent on the extension of the foundations of geometry beyond Riemann, as shown in Chapter II, and represents an
attempt to derive from world-geometry not only gravitational but
also electromagnetic phenomena. Even if this theory is still only
in its infant stage, I feel convinced that it contains no less truth
than Einstein’s Theory of Gravitation—whether this amount of
truth is unlimited or, what is more probable, is bounded by the
Quantum Theory.
I wish to thank Mr. Weinstein for his help in correcting the
proof-sheets.

#### PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION

In this edition the book has on the whole preserved its general
form, but there are a number of small changes and additions, the
most important of which are: (1) A paragraph added to Chapter II
in which the problem of space is formulated in conformity with the
view of the Theory of Groups; we endeavour to arrive at an understanding of the inner necessity and uniqueness of Pythagorean


-----

termined gravitational equations is that the scalar of curvature is
the only invariant having a certain character in Riemann’s space.
(3) In Chapter IV the more recent experimental researches dealing
with the general theory of relativity are taken into consideration,
particularly the deflection of rays of light by the gravitational field
of the sun, as was shown during the solar eclipse of 29th May,
1919, the results of which aroused great interest in the theory on
all sides. (4) With Mie’s view of matter there is contrasted another (vide particularly § 32 and § 36), according to which matter
is a limiting singularity of the field, but charges and masses are
force-fluxes in the field. This entails a new and more cautious
attitude towards the whole problem of matter.
Thanks are due to various known and unknown readers for
pointing out desirable modifications, and to Professor Nielsen (at
Breslau) for kindly reading the proof-sheets.

In this rendering of Professor Weyl’s book into English, pains
have been taken to adhere as closely as possible to the original,
not only as regards the general text, but also in the choice of
English equivalents for technical expressions. For example, the
word affine has been retained. It is used by Möbius in his Der
_Barycentrische Calcul, in which he quotes a Latin definition of the_
term as given by Euler. Veblen and Young have used the word in
their Projective Geometry, so that it is not quite unfamiliar to English mathematicians. Abbildung, which signifies representation,
is generally rendered equally well by transformation, inasmuch as
it denotes a copy of certain elements of one space mapped out on,
or expressed in terms of, another space. In some cases the German word is added in parenthesis for the sake of those who wish
to pursue the subject further in original papers. It is hoped that
the appearance of this English edition will lead to further efforts
towards extending Einstein’s ideas so as to embrace all physical
knowledge. Much has been achieved, yet much remains to be done.
The brilliant speculations of the latter chapters of this book show
how vast is the field that has been opened up by Einstein’s genius.
The work of translation has been a great pleasure, and I wish to
acknowledge here the courtesy with which suggestions concerning the type and the symbols have been received and followed by
Messrs. Methuen & Co. Ltd. Acting on the advice of interested
mathematicians and physicists I have used Clarendon type for
the vector notation. My warm thanks are due to Professor G. H.
Hardy of New College and Mr. T. W. Chaundy, M.A., of Christ
Church, for valuable suggestions and help in looking through the

#### INTRODUCTION

**Space and time are commonly regarded as the forms of ex-**
istence of the real world, matter as its substance. A definite
portion of matter occupies a definite part of space at a definite
moment of time. It is in the composite idea of motion that these
three fundamental conceptions enter into intimate relationship.
Descartes defined the objective of the exact sciences as consisting
in the description of all happening in terms of these three fundamental conceptions, thus referring them to motion. Since the
human mind first wakened from slumber, and was allowed to give
itself free rein, it has never ceased to feel the profoundly mysterious nature of time-consciousness, of the progression of the world
in time,—of Becoming. It is one of those ultimate metaphysical
problems which philosophy has striven to elucidate and unravel
at every stage of its history. The Greeks made Space the subjectmatter of a science of supreme simplicity and certainty. Out of
it grew, in the mind of classical antiquity, the idea of pure science. Geometry became one of the most powerful expressions of
that sovereignty of the intellect that inspired the thought of those
times. At a later epoch, when the intellectual despotism of the
Church, which had been maintained through the Middle Ages,
had crumbled, and a wave of scepticism threatened to sweep away
all that had seemed most fixed, those who believed in Truth clung
to Geometry as to a rock, and it was the highest ideal of every scientist to carry on his science “more geometrico”. Matter
was imagined to be a substance involved in every change, and it


-----

q y, p
was the Law of Conservation of Matter which asserts that matter remains constant in amount throughout every change. This,
which has hitherto represented our knowledge of space and matter, and which was in many quarters claimed by philosophers as
_a priori knowledge, absolutely general and necessary, stands to-_
day a tottering structure. First, the physicists in the persons
of Faraday and Maxwell, proposed the “electromagnetic field” in
contra-distinction to matter, as a reality of a different category.
Then, during the last century, the mathematician, following a different line of thought, secretly undermined belief in the evidence
of Euclidean Geometry. And now, in our time, there has been unloosed a cataclysm which has swept away space, time, and matter
hitherto regarded as the firmest pillars of natural science, but only
to make place for a view of things of wider scope, and entailing a
deeper vision.
This revolution was promoted essentially by the thought of one
man, Albert Einstein. The working-out of the fundamental ideas
seems, at the present time, to have reached a certain conclusion;
yet, whether or not we are already faced with a new state of affairs,
we feel ourselves compelled to subject these new ideas to a close
analysis. Nor is any retreat possible. The development of scientific
thought may once again take us beyond the present achievement,
but a return to the old narrow and restricted scheme is out of the
question.
Philosophy, mathematics, and physics have each a share in the
problems presented here. We shall, however, be concerned above
all with the mathematical and physical aspect of these questions.
I shall only touch lightly on the philosophical implications for the


-----

, y p p
give such answers to the epistemological questions involved as my
conscience would allow me to uphold. The ideas to be worked out
in this book are not the result of some speculative inquiry into the
foundations of physical knowledge, but have been developed in the
ordinary course of the handling of concrete physical problems—
problems arising in the rapid development of science which has, as
it were, burst its old shell, now become too narrow. This revision
of fundamental principles was only undertaken later, and then
only to the extent necessitated by the newly formulated ideas. As
things are to-day, there is left no alternative but that the separate
sciences should each proceed along these lines dogmatically, that is
to say, should follow in good faith the paths along which they are
led by reasonable motives proper to their own peculiar methods
and special limitations. The task of shedding philosophic light on
to these questions is none the less an important one, because it
is radically different from that which falls to the lot of individual
sciences. This is the point at which the philosopher must exercise
his discretion. If he keep in view the boundary lines determined
by the difficulties inherent in these problems, he may direct, but
must not impede, the advance of sciences whose field of inquiry is
confined to the domain of concrete objects.
Nevertheless I shall begin with a few reflections of a philosophical character. As human beings engaged in the ordinary activities of our daily lives, we find ourselves confronted in our acts of
perception by material things. We ascribe a “real” existence to
them, and we accept them in general as constituted, shaped, and
coloured in such and such a way, and so forth, as they appear to us
in our perception in “general,” that is ruling out possible illusions,


-----

g, y,
manifold, indefinite in outline, of analogous realities which unite to
form a single ever-present world of space to which I, with my own
body, belong. Let us here consider only these bodily objects, and
not all the other things of a different category, with which we as
ordinary beings are confronted; living creatures, persons, objects
of daily use, values, such entities as state, right, language, etc.
Philosophical reflection probably begins in every one of us who
is endowed with an abstract turn of mind when he first becomes
sceptical about the world-view of naïve realism to which I have
briefly alluded.
It is easily seen that such a quality as “green” has an existence only as the correlate of the sensation “green” associated
with an object given by perception, but that it is meaningless to
attach it as a thing in itself to material things existing in them**selves. This recognition of the subjectivity of the qualities of**
**sense is found in Galilei (and also in Descartes and Hobbes) in**
a form closely related to the principle underlying the construc**tive mathematical method of our modern physics which**
**repudiates “qualities”. According to this principle, colours are**
“really” vibrations of the æther, i.e. motions. In the field of philosophy Kant was the first to take the next decisive step towards the
point of view that not only the qualities revealed by the senses,
but also space and spatial characteristics have no objective significance in the absolute sense; in other words, that space, too, is
**only a form of our perception. In the realm of physics it is**
perhaps only the theory of relativity which has made it quite clear
that the two essences, space and time, entering into our intuition
have no place in the world constructed by mathematical physics.


-----

independent parameters corresponding to the three dimensions of
space, and the one of time.
Expressed as a general principle, this means that the real
world, and every one of its constituents with their accompanying
characteristics, are, and can only be given as, intentional objects
of acts of consciousness. The immediate data which I receive are
the experiences of consciousness in just the form in which I receive
them. They are not composed of the mere stuff of perception, as
many Positivists assert, but we may say that in a sensation an object, for example, is actually physically present for me—to whom
that sensation relates—in a manner known to every one, yet, since
it is characteristic, it cannot be described more fully. Following
Brentano, I shall call it the “intentional object”. In experiencing perceptions I see this chair, for example. My attention is fully
directed towards it. I “have” the perception, but it is only when I
make this perception in turn the intentional object of a new inner
perception (a free act of reflection enables me to do this) that I
“know” something regarding it (and not the chair alone), and ascertain precisely what I remarked just above. In this second act
the intentional object is immanent, i.e. like the act itself, it is a real
component of my stream of experiences, whereas in the primary
act of perception the object is transcendental, i.e. it is given in
an experience of consciousness, but is not a real component of it.
What is immanent is absolute, i.e. it is exactly what it is in the
form in which I have it, and I can reduce this, its essence, to the
axiomatic by acts of reflection. On the other hand, transcendental
objects have only a phenomenal existence; they are appearances
presenting themselves in manifold ways and in manifold “grada

-----

y, g y p
tion and the conditions of illumination. Neither of these modes
of appearance can claim to present the leaf just as it is “in itself”.
Furthermore, in every perception there is, without doubt, involved
the thesis of reality of the object appearing in it; the latter is,
indeed, a fixed and lasting element of the general thesis of reality of the world. When, however, we pass from the natural view
to the philosophical attitude, meditating upon perception, we no
longer subscribe to this thesis. We simply affirm that something
real is “supposed” in it. The meaning of such a supposition now
becomes the problem which must be solved from the data of consciousness. In addition a justifiable ground for making it must be
found. I do not by this in any way wish to imply that the view
that the events of the world are a mere play of the consciousness
produced by the ego, contains a higher degree of truth than naïve
realism; on the contrary, we are only concerned in seeing clearly
that the datum of consciousness is the starting-point at which we
must place ourselves if we are to understand the absolute meaning
as well as the right to the supposition of reality. In the field of
logic we have an analogous case. A judgment, which I pronounce,
affirms a certain set of circumstances; it takes them as true. Here,
again, the philosophical question of the meaning of, and the justification for, this thesis of truth arises; here, again, the idea of
objective truth is not denied, but becomes a problem which has
to be grasped from what is given absolutely. “Pure consciousness”
is the seat of that which is philosophically a priori. On the other
hand, a philosophic examination of the thesis of truth must and
will lead to the conclusion that none of these acts of perception,
memory, etc., which present experiences from which I seize reality,


-----

p g y
in its turn be over-ridden by rights founded on other perceptions,
etc.
It is the nature of a real thing to be inexhaustible in content;
we can get an ever deeper insight into this content by the continual addition of new experiences, partly in apparent contradiction,
by bringing them into harmony with one another. In this interpretation, things of the real world are approximate ideas. From
this arises the empirical character of all our knowledge of reality.[∗]

Time is the primitive form of the stream of consciousness. It
is a fact, however obscure and perplexing to our minds, that the
contents of consciousness do not present themselves simply as being (such as conceptions, numbers, etc.), but as being now filling
the form of the enduring present with a varying content. So that
one does not say this is but this is now, yet now no more. If we
project ourselves outside the stream of consciousness and represent its content as an object, it becomes an event happening in
time, the separate stages of which stand to one another in the
relations of earlier and later.
Just as time is the form of the stream of consciousness, so one
may justifiably assert that space is the form of external material
reality. All characteristics of material things as they are presented
to us in the acts of external perception (e.g. colour) are endowed
with the separateness of spatial extension, but it is only when we
build up a single connected real world out of all our experiences
that the spatial extension, which is a constituent of every perception, becomes a part of one and the same all-inclusive space. Thus
space is the form of the external world. That is to say, every ma

position in Space different from its present one. This immediately
gives us the property of the homogeneity of space which is the
root of the conception, Congruence.
Now, if the worlds of consciousness and of transcendental reality were totally different from one another, or, rather, if only the
passive act of perception bridged the gulf between them, the state
of affairs would remain as I have just represented it, namely, on
the one hand a consciousness rolling on in the form of a lasting
present, yet spaceless; on the other, a reality spatially extended,
yet timeless, of which the former contains but a varying appearance. Antecedent to all perception there is in us the experience
of effort and of opposition, of being active and being passive. For
a person leading a natural life of activity, perception serves above
all to place clearly before his consciousness the definite point of
attack of the action he wills, and the source of the opposition to
it. As the doer and endurer of actions I become a single individual with a psychical reality attached to a body which has its
place in space among the material things of the external world,
and by which I am in communication with other similar individuals. Consciousness, without surrendering its immanence, becomes
a piece of reality, becomes this particular person, namely myself,
who was born and will die. Moreover, as a result of this, consciousness spreads out its web, in the form of time, over reality.
Change, motion, elapse of time, becoming and ceasing to be, exist
in time itself; just as my will acts on the external world through
and beyond my body as a motive power, so the external world
is in its turn active (as the German word “Wirklichkeit,” reality,
derived from “wirken” = to act, indicates). Its phenomena are re

one another. The new solution of the problem of amalgamating
space and time offered by the theory of relativity brings with it a
deeper insight into the harmony of action in the world.
The course of our future line of argument is thus clearly outlined. What remains to be said of time, treated separately, and
of grasping it mathematically and conceptually may be included
in this introduction. We shall have to deal with space at much
greater length. Chapter I will be devoted to a discussion of Eu**clidean space and its mathematical structure.** In Chapter II
will be developed those ideas which compel us to pass beyond the
Euclidean scheme; this reaches its climax in the general spaceconception of the metrical continuum (Riemann’s conception of
space). Following upon this Chapter III will discuss the problem mentioned just above of the amalgamation of Space and
Time in the world. From this point on the results of mechanics
and physics will play an important part, inasmuch as this problem by its very nature, as has already been remarked, comes into
our view of the world as an active entity. The edifice constructed
out of the ideas contained in Chapters II and III will then in the
final Chapter IV lead us to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativ_ity, which, physically, entails a new Theory of Gravitation, and_
also to an extension of the latter which embraces electromagnetic
phenomena in addition to gravitation. The revolutions which are
brought about in our notions of Space and Time will of necessity
affect the conception of matter too. Accordingly, all that has to
be said about matter will be dealt with appropriately in Chapters
III and IV.

(present) as a point of Time—i.e. to be able to indicate points
of time, one of which will always be the earlier and the other the
later. The following principle will hold for this “order-relation”.
If A is earlier than B and B is earlier than C, then A is earlier
than C. Each two points of Time, A and B, of which A is the
earlier, mark off a length of time; this includes every point which
is later than A and earlier than B. The fact that Time is a form of
our stream of experience is expressed in the idea of equality: the
empirical content which fills the length of Time AB can in itself
be put into any other time without being in any way different
from what it is. The length of time which it would then occupy is
equal to the distance AB. This, with the help of the principle of
causality, gives us the following objective criterion in physics for
equal lengths of time. If an absolutely isolated physical system
(i.e. one not subject to external influences) reverts once again to
exactly the same state as that in which it was at some earlier
instant, then the same succession of states will be repeated in
time and the whole series of events will constitute a cycle. In
general such a system is called a clock. Each period of the cycle
lasts equally long.
The mathematical fixing of time by measuring it is based
upon these two relations, “earlier (or later) times” and “equal
times”. The nature of measurement may be indicated briefly as
follows: Time is homogeneous, i.e. a single point of time can only
be given by being specified individually. There is no inherent property arising from the general nature of time which may be ascribed
to any one point but not to any other; or, every property logically
derivable from these two fundamental relations belongs either to

holds for one point-pair must hold for every point-pair AB (in
which A is earlier than B). A difference arises, however, in the
case of three point-pairs. If any two time-points O and E are given
such that O is earlier than E, it is possible to fix conceptually further time-points P by referring them to the unit-distance OE.
This is done by constructing logically a relation t between three
points such that for every two points O and E, of which O is
the earlier, there is one and only one point P which satisfies the
relation t between O, E and P, i.e. symbolically,

_OP = t · OE_

(e.g. OP = 2 · OE denotes the relation OE = EP ). **Num-**
**bers are merely concise symbols for such relations as t, defined**
logically from the primary relations. P is the “time-point with
the abscissa t in the co-ordinate system (taking OE as unit
length)”. Two different numbers t and t[∗] in the same co-ordinate
system necessarily lead to two different points; for, otherwise, in
consequence of the homogeneity of the continuum of time-lengths,
the property expressed by

_t · AB = t[∗]_ _· AB,_

since it belongs to the time-length AB = OE, must belong to
**every time-length, and hence the equations AC = t · AB, AC =**
_t[∗]_ _·_ _AB would both express the same relation, i.e. t would be equal_
to t[∗]. Numbers enable us to single out separate time-points relatively to a unit-distance OE out of the time-continuum by a
conceptual and hence objective and precise process But the ob

the co-ordinate system which can only be specified by an individual act (and then only approximately) remains as an inevitable
residuum of this elimination of the percipient.
It seems to me that by formulating the principle of measurement in the above terms we see clearly how mathematics has come
to play its rôle in exact natural science. _An essential feature_
_of measurement is the difference between the “determination” of_
_an object by individual specification and the determination of the_
_same object by some conceptual means. The latter is only possi-_
ble relatively to objects which must be defined directly. That is
why a theory of relativity is perforce always involved in measurement. The general problem which it proposes for an arbitrary
domain of objects takes the form: (1) What must be given such
that relatively to it (and to any desired order of precision) one can
single out conceptually a single arbitrary object P from the continuously extended domain of objects under consideration? That
which has to be given is called the co-ordinate system, the conceptual definition is called the co-ordinate (or abscissa) of P
in the co-ordinate system. Two different co-ordinate systems are
completely equivalent for an objective standpoint. There is no
property, that can be fixed conceptually, which applies to one coordinate system but not to the other; for in that case too much
would have been given directly. (2) What relationship exists between the co-ordinates of one and the same arbitrary object P in
two different co-ordinate systems?
In the realm of time-points, with which we are at present concerned, the answer to the first question is that the co-ordinate
system consists of a time-length OE (giving the origin and the

in which a and b are constants, whilst t and t[′] are the co-ordinates
of the same arbitrary point P in an “unaccented” and “accented”
system respectively. For all possible pairs of co-ordinate systems
the characteristic numbers, a and b, of the transformation may
be any real numbers with the limitation that a must always be
positive. The aggregate of transformations constitutes a group,
as their nature would imply, i.e.,
1. “identity” t = t[′] is contained in it.
2. Every transformation is accompanied by its reciprocal in the
group, i.e. by the transformation which exactly cancels its effect.
Thus, the inverse of the transformation (a, b), viz. t = at[′] + b, is

3. If two transformations of a group are given, then the one
which is produced by applying these two successively also belongs
to the group. It is at once evident that, by applying the two
transformations

_t = at[′]_ + b _t[′]_ = a[′]t[′′] + b[′]

in succession, we get
_t = a1t[′′]_ + b1

where a1 = a · a[′] and b1 = (ab[′]) + b; and if a and a[′] are positive,
so is their product.

of the two forms of this world, space and time. By choosing a coordinate system for space and time, we may also fix the physically
real content of the world conceptually in all its parts by means of
numbers.
All beginnings are obscure. Inasmuch as the mathematician
operates with his conceptions along strict and formal lines, he,
above all, must be reminded from time to time that the origins
of things lie in greater depths than those to which his methods
enable him to descend. Beyond the knowledge gained from the
individual sciences, there remains the task of comprehending.
In spite of the fact that the views of philosophy sway from one
system to another, we cannot dispense with it unless we are to
convert knowledge into a meaningless chaos.

EUCLIDEAN SPACE. ITS MATHEMATICAL
FORMULATION AND ITS RÔLE IN PHYSICS

**§ 1. Deduction of the Elementary Conceptions of Space**
**from that of Equality**

Just as we fixed the present moment (“now”) as a geometrical
point in time, so we fix an exact “here,” a point in space, as the
first element of continuous spatial extension, which, like time, is
infinitely divisible. Space is not a one-dimensional continuum like
time. The principle by which it is continuously extended cannot
be reduced to the simple relation of “earlier” or “later”. We shall
refrain from inquiring what relations enable us to grasp this continuity conceptually. On the other hand, space, like time, is a form
of phenomena. Precisely the same content, identically the same
thing, still remaining what it is, can equally well be at some place
in space other than that at which it is actually. The new portion
of Space S[′] then occupied by it is equal to that portion S which
it actually occupied. S and S[′] are said to be congruent. To
every point P of S there corresponds one definite homologous
point P _[′]_ of S[′] which, after the above displacement to a new position, would be surrounded by exactly the same part of the given
content as that which surrounded P originally. We shall call this
“transformation” (in virtue of which the point P _[′]_ corresponds to
the point P ) a congruent transformation. Provided that the
appropriate subjective conditions are satisfied the given material
thing would seem to us after the displacement exactly the same
as before. There is reasonable justification for believing that a

q y p p ; y **g** y
mean one which, however it be moved or treated, can always be
made to appear the same to us as before, if we take up the appropriate position with respect to it. I shall evolve the scheme of
geometry from the conception of equality combined with that of
continuous connection—of which the latter offers great difficulties
to analysis—and shall show in a superficial sketch how all fundamental conceptions of geometry may be traced back to them. My
real object in doing so will be to single out translations among
possible congruent transformations. Starting from the conception of translation I shall then develop Euclidean geometry along
strictly axiomatic lines.
First of all the straight line. Its distinguishing feature is that
it is determined by two of its points. Any other line can, even
when two of its points are kept fixed, be brought into another
position by a congruent transformation (the test of straightness).
Thus, if A and B are two different points, the straight line
_g = AB includes every point which becomes transformed into it-_
self by all those congruent transformations which transform AB
into themselves. (In familiar language, the straight line lies evenly
between its points.) Expressed kinematically, this is tantamount
to saying that we regard the straight line as an axis of rotation.
It is homogeneous and a linear continuum just like time. Any
arbitrary point on it divides it into two parts, two “rays”. If B lies
on one of these parts and C on the other, then A is said to be
between B and C and the points of one part lie to the right of A,
the points of the other part to the left. (The choice as to which
is right or left is determined arbitrarily.) The simplest fundamental facts which are implied by the conception “between” can be


-----

p y p
endeavour to trace back all conceptions of continuity to the conception “between,” i.e. to the relation “A is a point of the straight
line BC and lies between B and C” (this is the reverse of the real
intuitional relation). Suppose A[′] to be a point on g to the right
of A, then A[′] also divides the line g into two parts. We call that
to which A belongs the left-hand side. If, however, A[′] lies to the
left of A the position is reversed. With this convention, analogous
relations hold not only for A and A[′] but also for any two points
of a straight line. The points of a straight line are ordered by the
terms left and right in precisely the same way as points of time
by the terms earlier and later.
Left and right are equivalent. There is one congruent transformation which leaves A fixed, but which interchanges the two
halves into which A divides the straight line. Every finite portion
of straight line AB may be superposed upon itself in such a way
that it is reversed (i.e. so that B falls on A, and A falls on B).
On the other hand, a congruent transformation which transforms
_A into itself, and all points to the right of A into points to the_
right of A, and all points to the left of A into points to the left
of A, leaves every point of the straight line undisturbed. The
homogeneity of the straight line is expressed in the fact that the
straight line can be placed upon itself in such a way that any
point A of it can be transformed into any other point A[′] of it, and
that the half to the right of A can be transformed into the half to
the right of A[′], and likewise for the portions to the left of A and A[′]

respectively (this implies a mere translation of the straight line).
If we now introduce the equation AB = A[′]B[′] for the points of the
straight line by interpreting it as meaning that AB is transformed

p
enable us to introduce numbers, and to establish a reversible and
single correspondence between the points of a straight line and
real numbers by using a unit of length OE.
Let us now consider the group of congruent transformations
which leaves the straight line g fixed, i.e. transforms every point
of g into a point of g again.
We have called particular attention to rotations among these
as having the property of leaving not only g as a whole, but also
every single point of g unmoved in position. How can translations
in this group be distinguished from twists?
I shall here outline a preliminary argument in which not only
the straight line, but also the plane is based on a property of
rotation.
Two rays which start from a point O form an angle. Every
angle can, when inverted, be superposed exactly upon itself, so
that one arm falls on the other, and vice versa. Every right angle
is congruent with its complementary angle. Thus, if h is a straight
line perpendicular to g at the point A, then there is one rotation
about g (“inversion”) which interchanges the two halves into which
_h is divided by A. All the straight lines which are perpendicular_
to g at A together form the plane E through A perpendicular to g.
Each pair of these perpendicular straight lines may be produced
from any other by a rotation about g.
If g is inverted, and placed upon itself in some way, so that A is
transformed into itself, but so that the two halves into which A
divides g are interchanged, then the plane E of necessity coincides
with itself. The plane may also be defined by taking this property
in conjunction with that of symmetry of rotation. Two congruent

plane if, by means of inverting one, so that its axis is vertical in
the opposite direction, and placing it on the other, the two tablesurfaces can be made to coincide. The plane is homogeneous. The
point A on E which appears as the centre in this example is in
no way unique among the points of E. A straight line g[′] passes
through each one A[′] of them in such a way that E is made up
of all straight lines through A[′] perpendicular to g[′]. The straight
lines g[′] which are perpendicular to E at its points A[′] respectively
form a group of parallel straight lines. The straight line g with
which we started is in no wise unique among them. The straight
lines of this group occupy the whole of space in such a way that
only one straight line of the group passes through each point of
space. This in no way depends on the point A of the straight
line g, at which the above construction was performed.
If A[∗] is any point on g, then the plane which is erected normally
to g at A[∗] cuts not only g perpendicularly, but also all straight
lines of the group of parallels. All such normal planes E[∗] which

take another small step to pass from the above framework of space
to the rectangular system of co-ordinates. We shall use it here,
however, to fix the conception of spatial translation.
Translation is a congruent transformation which transforms
not only g but every straight line of the group of parallels into
itself. There is one and only one translation which transfers the
arbitrary point A on g to the arbitrary point A[∗] on the same
straight line.
I shall now give an alternate method of arriving at the conception of translation. The chief characteristic of translation is
that all points are of equal importance in it, and that the behaviour of a point during translation does not allow any objective
assertion to be made about it, which could not equally well be
made of any other point (this means that the points of space for
a given translation can only be distinguished by specifying each
one singly [“that one there”], whereas in the case of rotation, for
example, the points on the axis are distinguished by the property
that they preserve their positions). By using this as a basis we
get the following definition of translation, which is quite independent of the conception of rotation. Let the arbitrary point P be
transformed into P _[′]_ by a congruent transformation: we shall call
_P and P_ _[′]_ connected points. A second congruent transformation
which has the property of again transforming every pair of connected points into connected points, is to be called interchange**able with the first transformation. A congruent transformation**
is then called a translation, if it gives rise to interchangeable congruent transformations, which transform the arbitrary point A
into the arbitrary point B. The statement that two congruent


-----

p ) g
tion resulting from the successive application of I and II is identical
with that which results when these two transformations are performed in the reverse order. It is a fact that one translation (and,
as we shall see, only one) exists, which transforms the arbitrary
point A into the arbitrary point B. Moreover, not only is it a
fact that, if T denote a translation and A and B any two points,
there is, according to our definition, a congruent transformation,
interchangeable with T, which transforms A into B, but also that
the particular translation which transforms A into B has the
required property. A translation is therefore interchangeable with
all other translations, and a congruent transformation which is
interchangeable with all translations is also necessarily a translation. From this it follows that the congruent transformation which
results from successively performing two translations, and also the
“inverse” of a translation (i.e. that transformation which exactly
reverses or neutralises the original translation) is itself a translation. Translations possess the “group” property.[∗] There is no
translation which transforms A into A except identity, in which
every point remains undisturbed. For if such a translation were
to transform P into P _[′], then, according to definition, there must_
be a congruent transformation, which transforms A into P and
simultaneously A into P _[′]; P and P_ _[′]_ must therefore be identical
points. Hence there cannot be two different translations both of
which transform A into another point B.
As the conception of translation has thus been defined independently of that of rotation, the translational view of the straight
line and plane may thus be formed in contrast with the above


-----

the point A0 to A. This same translation will transfer A1 to a
point A2, A2 to A3, etc. Moreover, through it A0 will be derived
from a certain point A−1, A−1 from A−2, etc. This does not yet
give us the whole straight line, but only a series of equidistant
points on it. Now, if n is a natural number (integer), a translation **[a]**

_n_ [exists which, when repeated][ n][ times, gives][ a][. If, then,]

starting from the point A0 we use _n[a]_ [in the same way as we just]

now used a we shall obtain an array of points on the straight line
under construction, which will be n times as dense.
If we take all possible whole numbers as values of n this array will become denser in proportion as n increases, and all the
points which we obtain finally fuse together into a linear continuum, in which they become embedded, giving up their individual
existences (this description is founded on our intuition of continuity). We may say that the straight line is derived from a point by
an infinite repetition of the same infinitesimal translation and its
inverse. A plane, however, is derived by translating one straight
line, g, along another, h. If g and h are two different straight
lines passing through the point A0, then if we apply to g all the
translations which transform h into itself, all straight lines which
thus result from g together form the common plane of g and h.
We succeed in introducing logical order into the structure of
geometry only if we first narrow down the general conception of
congruent transformation to that of translation, and use this as
an axiomatic foundation (§§ 2 and 3). By doing this, however,
we arrive at a geometry of translation alone, viz. affine geometry

into the region of deductive mathematics.

**§ 2. The Foundations of Affine Geometry**

For the present we shall use the term vector to denote a translation or a displacement a in the space. Later we shall have occasion to attach a wider meaning to it. The statement that the
displacement a transfers the point P to the point Q (“transforms”
_P into Q) may also be expressed by saying that Q is the end-point_
of the vector a whose starting-point is at P . If P and Q are any
two points then there is one and only one displacement a which
transfers P to Q. We shall call it the vector defined by P and Q,
and indicate it by _[−→]PQ._
The translation c which arises through two successive translations a and b is called the sum of a and b, i.e. c = a + b.
The definition of summation gives us: (1) the meaning of multiplication (repetition) and of the division of a vector by an integer;
(2) the purport of the operation which transforms the vector a
into its inverse −a; (3) the meaning of the nil-vector 0, viz. “identity,” which leaves all points fixed, i.e. a+0 = a and a+(−a) = 0.
It also tells us what is conveyed by the symbols ±[m][a] = λa, in

_n_

which m and n are any two natural numbers (integers) and λ denotes the fraction ±[m]n [. By taking account of the postulate of]

continuity this also gives us the significance of λa, when λ is any
real number. The following system of axioms may be set up for
affine geometry:—


-----

Two vectors a and b uniquely determine a vector a + b as
their sum. A number λ and a vector a uniquely define a vector λa,
which is “λ times a” (multiplication). These operations are subject
to the following laws:—
(α) Addition—
(1) a + b = b + a (Commutative Law).
(2) (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) (Associative Law).
(3) If a and c are any two vectors, then there is one and only
one value of x for which the equation a + x = c holds. It is called
the difference between c and a and signifies c − **a (Possibility of**
Subtraction).
(β) Multiplication—
(1) (λ + µ)a = (λa) + (µa) (First Distributive Law).
(2) λ(µa) = (λµ)a (Associative Law).
(3) 1 · a = a.
(4) λ(a + b) = (λa) + (λb) (Second Distributive Law).
For rational multipliers λ, µ, the laws (β) follow from the axioms of addition if multiplication by such factors be defined from
addition. In accordance with the principle of continuity we shall
also make use of them for any arbitrary real numbers, but we purposely formulate them as separate axioms because they cannot be
derived in the general form from the axioms of addition by logical
reasoning alone. By refraining from reducing multiplication to addition we are enabled through these axioms to banish continuity,
which is so difficult to fix precisely, from the logical structure of
geometry. The law (β) 4 comprises the theorems of similarity.
(γ) The “Axiom of Dimensionality,” which occupies the next
l i h ill b f l d l


-----

1. Every pair of points A and B determines a vector a; expressed symbolically _[−→]AB = a. If A is any point and a any vector,_
there is one and only one point B for which _[−→]AB = a._
2. If _[−→]AB = a,_ _[−−→]BC = b, then_ _[−→]AC = a + b._
In these axioms two fundamental categories of objects occur,
viz. points and vectors; and there are three fundamental relations,
those expressed symbolically by—

_−→_
**a + b = c** **b = λa** _AB = a._ (1)

All conceptions which may be defined from (1) by logical reasoning
alone belong to affine geometry. The doctrine of affine geometry
is composed of all theorems which can be deduced logically from
the axioms (1), and it can thus be erected deductively on the
axiomatic basis (1) and (2). The axioms are not all logically independent of one another for the axioms of addition for vectors
(Iα, 2 and 3) follow from those (II) which govern the relations between points and vectors. It was our aim, however, to make the
vector-axioms I suffice in themselves, so that we should be able to
deduce from them all those facts which involve vectors exclusively
(and not the relations between vectors and points).
From the axioms of addition Iα we may conclude that a definite
vector 0 exists which, for every vector a, satisfies the equation
**a + 0 = a.** From the axioms II it further follows that _[−→]AB is_
equal to this vector 0 when, and only when, the points A and B
coincide.

exact definition which rests solely upon the fundamental conceptions involved in the system of affine axioms. Those points P for
which the abscissa ξ is positive form one-half of the straight line
through O, those for which ξ is negative form the other half. If
we write e1 in place of e, and if e2 is another vector, which is not
of the form ξe1, then the end-points P of all vectors _[−→]OP which_
have the form ξ1e1 + _ξ2e2 form a plane E (in this way the plane is_
derived affinely by sliding one straight line along another). If we
now displace the plane E along a straight line passing through O
but not lying on E, the plane passes through all space. Accordingly, if e3 is a vector not expressible in the form ξ1e1 + ξ2e2,
then every vector can be represented in one and only one way as
a linear combination of e1, e2, and e3, viz.

_ξ1e1 + ξ2e2 + ξ3e3._

We thus arrive at the following set of definitions:—
A finite number of vectors e1, e2, . . ., eh is said to be linearly
**independent if**

_ξ1e1 + ξ2e2 + · · · + ξheh_ (2)

only vanishes when all the co-efficients ξ vanish simultaneously.
With this assumption all vectors of the form (2) together constitute a so-called h-dimensional linear vector-manifold (or
simply vector-field); in this case it is the one mapped out by the
vectors e1, e2, . . ., eh. An h-dimensional linear vector-manifold M
can be characterised without referring to its particular base e, as
follows:—

the product of such a vector and any real number also lie in M.
(2) There are h linearly independent vectors in M, but every
_h + 1 are linearly dependent on one another._
From the property (2) (which may be deduced from our original definition with the help of elementary results of linear equations) it follows that h, the dimensional number, is as such characteristic of the manifold, and is not dependent on the special vector
base by which we map it out. The dimensional axiom which was
omitted in the above table of axioms may now be formulated.
**There are n linearly independent vectors, but every**
_n + 1 are linearly dependent on one another,_
or: The vectors constitute an n-dimensional linear manifold. If
_n = 3 we have affine geometry of space, if n = 2 plane geometry,_
if n = 1 geometry of the straight line. In the deductive treatment of geometry it will, however, be expedient to leave the value
of n undetermined, and to develop an “n-dimensional geometry”
in which that of the straight line, of the plane, and of space are
included as special cases. For we see (at present for affine geometry, later on for all geometry) that there is nothing in the
mathematical structure of space to prevent us from exceeding the
dimensional number 3. In the light of the mathematical uniformity of space as expressed in our axioms, its special dimensional
number 3 appears to be accidental, so that a systematic deductive theory cannot be restricted by it. We shall revert to the idea
of an n-dimensional geometry, obtained in this way, in the next
paragraph.[∗] We must first complete the definitions outlined.

an h-dimensional vector field M as represented by (2), occupy fully
**an h-dimensional point-configuration. We may, as before,**
say that it is mapped out by the vectors e1, e2, . . ., eh, which
start from O. The one-dimensional configuration of this type is
called a straight line, the two-dimensional a plane. The point O
does not play a unique part in this linear configuration. If O[′] is any
other point of it, then _[−−→]O[′]P traverses the same vector manifold M_
if all possible points of the linear aggregate are substituted for P
in turn.
If we measure off all vectors of the manifold M firstly from
the point O and then from any other arbitrary point O[′] the two
resulting linear point aggregates are said to be parallel to one
another. The definition of parallel planes and parallel straight
lines is contained in this. That part of the h-dimensional linear
assemblage which results when we measure off all the vectors (2)
from O, subject to the limitation

0 ≤ _ξ1 ≤_ 1, 0 ≤ _ξ2 ≤_ 1, _. . .,_ 0 ≤ _ξh ≤_ 1,

will be called the h-dimensional parallelepiped which has its
origin at O and is mapped out by the vectors e1, e2, . . ., eh.
(The one-dimensional parallelepiped is called distance, the twodimensional one is called parallelogram. None of these conceptions is limited to the case n = 3, which is presented in ordinary
experience.)
A point O in conjunction with n linear independent vectors e1,
**e2, . . ., eh will be called a co-ordinate system (C). Every vector x**

system (C). Ifξi P is any arbitrary point and ifp _[−→]OP is equal to_
the vector (3), then the ξi are called the co-ordinates of P . All
co-ordinate systems are equivalent in affine geometry. There is no
property of this geometry which distinguishes one from another.

Formulæ (6) which give the transformation for the co-ordinates are
thus linear. Those (viz. 5) which transform the vector components
are easily derived from them by cancelling the terms αi which
do not involve the variables. An analytical treatment of affine
geometry is possible, in which every vector is represented by its
components and every point by its co-ordinates. The geometrical
relations between points and vectors then express themselves as
relations between their components and co-ordinates respectively
of such a kind that they are not destroyed by linear arbitrary
transformations.
Formulæ (5) and (6) may also be interpreted in another way.
They may be regarded as a mode of representing an affine trans**formation in a definite co-ordinate system. A transformation, i.e.**
a rule which assigns a vector x[′] to every vector x and a point P _[′]_

to every point P, is called linear or affine if the fundamental affine
relations (1) are not disturbed by the transformation: so that if
the relations (1) hold for the original points and vectors they also
hold for the transformed points and vectors:

affine property possessed by the one which is not possessed by

the same part in affine geometry as congruence plays in general

configuration into a like configuration; parallels into parallels; a

Let the numbers αk[i] [,][ α][i][, have the same meaning as above. The]

next paragraph. Here we shall just add the fundamental conception of “linear forms” upon which this discussion is founded. A
function L(x), the argument x of which assumes the value of every vector in turn, these values being real numbers only, is called
a linear form, if it has the functional properties

_L(a + b) = L(a) + L(b);_ _L(λa) = λ · L(a)._

In a co-ordinate system e1, e2, . . ., en each of the n vectorcomponents ξi of x is such a linear form. If x is defined by (3),
then any arbitrary linear form L satisfies

_L(x) = ξ1L(e1) + ξ2L(e2) + · · · + ξnL(en)._

Thus if we put L(ei) = ai, the linear form, expressed in terms of
components, appears in the form

_a1ξ1 + a2ξ2 + · · · + anξn_ (the ai’s are its constant co-efficients).

Conversely, every expression of this type gives a linear form. A
number of linear forms L1, L2, L3, . . ., Lh are linearly independent, if no constants λi exist, for which the identity-equation
holds:
_λ1L1(x) + λ2L2(x) + . . . + λhLh(x) = 0_

except λi = 0. _n + 1 linear forms are always linearly inter-_
dependent.

gree in physics, has it become more and more evident that as soon
as we have succeeded in unravelling fully the natural laws which
govern reality, we find them to be expressible by mathematical
relations of surpassing simplicity and architectonic perfection. It
seems to me to be one of the chief objects of mathematical instruction to develop the faculty of perceiving this simplicity and
harmony, which we cannot fail to observe in the theoretical physics
of the present day. It gives us deep satisfaction in our quest for
knowledge. Analytical geometry, presented in a compressed form
such as that I have used above in exposing its principles, conveys
an idea, even if inadequate, of this perfection of form. But not
only for this purpose must we go beyond the dimensional number
_n = 3, but also because we shall later require four-dimensional ge-_
ometry for concrete physical problems such as are introduced by
the theory of relativity, in which Time becomes added to Space
in a four-dimensional geometry.
We are by no means obliged to seek illumination from the
mystic doctrines of spiritists to obtain a clearer vision of multidimensional geometry. Let us consider, for instance, a homogeneous mixture of the four gases, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and
carbon dioxide. An arbitrary quantum of such a mixture is specified if we know how many grams of each gas are contained in it.
If we call each such quantum a vector (we may bestow names at
will) and if we interpret addition as implying the union of two
quanta of the gases in the ordinary sense, then all the axioms I
of our system referring to vectors are fulfilled for the dimensional
number n = 4, provided we agree also to talk of negative quanta of
gas. One gram of pure hydrogen, one gram of oxygen, one gram

be built up linearly; they thus form a co-ordinate system. Let
us take another example. We have five parallel horizontal bars
upon each of which a small bead slides. A definite condition of
this primitive “adding-machine” is defined if the position of each
of the five beads upon its respective rod is known. Let us call such
a condition a “point” and every simultaneous displacement of the
five beads a “vector,” then all of our axioms are satisfied for the
dimensional number n = 5. From this it is evident that constructions of various types may be evolved which, by an appropriate
disposal of names, satisfy our axioms. Infinitely more important
than these somewhat frivolous examples is the following one which
shows that our axioms characterise the basis of our opera**tions in the theory of linear equations. If αi and α are given**
numbers,
_α1x1 + α2x2 + . . . + αnxn = 0_ (7)

is usually called a homogeneous linear equation in the unknowns xi, whereas

_α1x1 + α2x2 + . . . + αnxn = α_ (8)

is called a non-homogeneous linear equation. In treating the
theory of linear homogeneous equations, it is found useful to have
a short name for the system of values of the variables xi; we shall
call it “vector”. In carrying out calculations with these vectors, we
shall define the sum of the two vectors

(a1, a2, . . ., an) and (b1, b2, . . ., bn)

to be the vector


-----

(λa1, λa2, . . ., λan).

The axioms I for vectors are then fulfilled for the dimensional
number n.

**e1 = (1, 0, 0, . . ., 0),**
**e2 = (0, 1, 0, . . ., 0),**
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
**en = (0, 0, 0, . . ., 1)**

form a system of independent vectors. The components of any
arbitrary vector (x1, x2, . . ., xn) in this co-ordinate system are the
numbers xi themselves. The fundamental theorem in the solution
of linear homogeneous equations may now be stated thus:—

if _L1(x),_ _L2(x),_ _. . .,_ _Lh(x)_

are h linearly independent linear forms, the solutions x of the
equations

_L1(x) = 0,_ _L2(x) = 0,_ _. . .,_ _Lh(x) = 0_

form an (n − _h)-dimensional linear vector manifold._
In the theory of non-homogeneous linear equations we shall
find it advantageous to denote a system of values of the variables xi
a “point”. If xi and x[′]i [are two systems which are solutions of]
equation (8), their difference


-----

p g g q ( )
shall, therefore, call this difference of two systems of values of
the variables xi a “vector,” viz. the “vector” defined by the two
“points” (xi) and (x[′]i[)][; we make the above conventions for the]
addition and multiplication of these vectors. **All the axioms**
**then hold. In the particular co-ordinate system composed of the**
vectors ei given above, and having the “origin” O = (0, 0, . . ., 0),
the co-ordinates of a point (xi) are the numbers xi themselves.
The fundamental theorem concerning linear equations is: those
points which satisfy h independent linear equations, form a pointconfiguration of n − _h dimensions._
In this way we should not only have arrived quite naturally
at our axioms without the help of geometry by using the theory
of linear equations, but we should also have reached the wider
conceptions which we have linked up with them. In some ways,
indeed, it would appear expedient (as is shown by the above formulation of the theorem concerning homogeneous equations) to
build up the theory of linear equations upon an axiomatic basis
by starting from the axioms which have here been derived from
geometry. A theory developed along these lines would then hold
for any domain of operations, for which these axioms are fulfilled,
and not only for a “system of values in n variables”. It is easy to
pass from such a theory which is more conceptual, to the usual one
of a more formal character which operates from the outset with
numbers xi by taking a definite co-ordinate system as a basis, and
then using in place of vectors and points their components and
co-ordinates respectively.
It is evident from these arguments that the whole of affine
geometry merely teaches us that space is a region of three di

separate facts of intuition which were mentioned in § 1 are simply
disguised forms of this one truth. Now, if on the one hand it is
very satisfactory to be able to give a common ground in the theory of knowledge for the many varieties of statements concerning
space, spatial configurations, and spatial relations which, taken
together, constitute geometry, it must on the other hand be emphasised that this demonstrates very clearly with what little right
mathematics may claim to expose the intuitional nature of space.
Geometry contains no trace of that which makes the space of intuition what it is in virtue of its own entirely distinctive qualities
which are not shared by “states of addition-machines” and “gasmixtures” and “systems of solutions of linear equations”. It is left
to metaphysics to make this “comprehensible” or indeed to show
why and in what sense it is incomprehensible. We as mathematicians have reason to be proud of the wonderful insight into the
knowledge of space which we gain, but, at the same time, we must
recognise with humility that our conceptual theories enable us to
grasp only one aspect of the nature of space, that which, moreover,
is most formal and superficial.
To complete the transition from affine geometry to complete
metrical geometry we yet require several conceptions and facts
which occur in linear algebra and which refer to bilinear and
**quadratic forms. A function Q(x, y) of two arbitrary vectors x**
and y is called a bilinear form if it is a linear form in x as well
as in y. If in a certain co-ordinate system ξi are the components
of x, ηi those of y, then an equation

_aikξi = 0_
_i=1_

have a single solution ξi = 0 or when the determinant |aik| ̸= 0.
From the above explanation it follows that this condition, viz.
the non-vanishing of the determinant, persists for arbitrary linear transformations. The bilinear form is called symmetrical if
_Q(y, x) = Q(x, y). This manifests itself in the co-efficients by the_
symmetrical property aki = aik. Every bilinear form Q(x, y) gives
rise to a quadratic form which depends on only one variable
vector x

_n_
�

_Q(x) = Q(x, x) =_ _aikξiξk._

_i,k=1_

In this way every quadratic form is derived in general from
one, and only one, symmetrical bilinear form. The quadratic
form Q(x) which we have just formed may also be produced from
the symmetrical form

1 �Q(x, y) + Q(y, x)�

by identifying x with y.
To prove that one and the same quadratic form cannot arise
from two different symmetrical bilinear forms, one need merely
show that a symmetrical bilinear form Q(x, y) which satisfies the
equation Q(x x) identically for x vanishes identically This how

-----

y

_Q(x + y, x + y) = Q(x, x) + 2Q(x, y) + Q(y, y)._ (9)

If Q(x) denotes any arbitrary quadratic form then Q(x, y) is always to signify the symmetrical bilinear form from which Q(x) is
derived (to avoid mentioning this in each particular case). When
we say that a quadratic form is non-degenerate we wish to convey
that the above symmetrical bilinear form is non-degenerate. A
quadratic form is positive definite if it satisfies the inequality
_Q(x) > 0 for every value of the vector x ̸= 0. Such a form is cer-_
tainly non-degenerate, for no value of the vector x ̸= 0 can make
_Q(x, y) vanish identically in y, since it gives a positive result for_
**y = x.**

**§ 4. The Foundations of Metrical Geometry**

To bring about the transition from affine to metrical geometry
we must once more draw from the fountain of intuition. From it
we obtain for three-dimensional space the definition of the scalar
**product of two vectors a and b. After selecting a definite vector**
as a unit we measure out the length of a and the length (negative
or positive as the case may be) of the perpendicular projection of b
upon a and multiply these two numbers with one another. This
means that the lengths of not only parallel straight lines may be
compared with one another (as in affine geometry) but also such
as are arbitrarily inclined to one another. The following rules hold
for scalar products:—

_λa · b = λ(a · b)_ (a + a[′]) · b = (a · b) + (a[′] _· b)_

and analogous expressions with reference to the second factor; in


-----

,, y p p
**a = 0, and is equal to the square of the length of a.** These
laws signify that the scalar product of two arbitrary vectors, i.e.
**x · y is a symmetrical bilinear form, and that the quadratic form**
which arises from it is positive definite. We thus see that not the
length, but the square of the length of a vector depends in a simple
rational way on the vector itself; it is a quadratic form. This is
the real content of Pythagoras’ Theorem. The scalar product is
nothing more than the symmetrical bilinear form from which this
quadratic form has been derived. We accordingly formulate the
following:—
Metrical Axiom: If a unit vector e, differing from zero, be
_chosen, every two vectors x and y uniquely determine a number_
(x·y) = Q(x, y); the latter, being dependent on the two vectors, is
_a symmetrical bilinear form._ The quadratic form (x · x) = Q(x)
which arises from it is positive definite. Q(e) = 1.
We shall call Q the metrical groundform. We then have that
_an affine transformation which, in general, transforms the vector x_
_into x[′]_ _is a congruent one if it leaves the metrical groundform_
_unchanged:—_
_Q(x[′]) = Q(x)._ (10)

_Two geometrical figures which can be transformed into one another_
_by a congruent transformation are congruent.[∗]_ The conception of
congruence is defined in our axiomatic scheme by these statements. If we have a domain of operation in which the axioms
of § 2 are fulfilled, we can choose any arbitrary positive definite

_∗We take no notice here of the difference between direct congruence and_
mirror congruence (lateral inversion). It is present even in affine transforma

q, p p
tal metrical form, and, using it as a basis, define the conception
of congruence as was just now done. This form then endows the
affine space with metrical properties and Euclidean geometry in
its entirety now holds for it. The formulation at which we have
arrived is not limited to any special dimensional number.
It follows from (10), in virtue of relation (9) of § 3, that for a
congruent transformation the more general relation

_Q(x[′], y[′]) = Q(x, y)_

holds.
Since the conception of congruence is defined by the metrical
groundform it is not surprising that the latter enters into all formulæ which concern the measure of geometrical quantities. Two
vectors a and a[′] are congruent if, and only if,

_Q(a) = Q(a[′])._

We could accordingly introduce Q(a) as a measure of the vector a. Instead of doing this, however, we shall use the positive
square root of Q(a) for this purpose and call it the length of the
vector a (this we shall adopt as our definition) so that the further
condition is fulfilled that the length of the sum of two parallel
vectors pointing in the same direction is equal to the sum of the
lengths of the two single vectors. If a, b as well as a[′], b[′] are two
pairs of vectors, all of length unity, then the figure formed by the
first two is congruent with that formed by the second pair, if, and
only if, Q(a, b) = Q(a[′], b[′]).
In this case again we do not introduce the number Q(a b)


-----

y

cos θ = Q(a, b)

so as to be in agreement with the theorem that the numerical
measure of an angle composed of two angles in the same plane is
the sum of the numerical values of these angles. The angle which
is formed from any two arbitrary vectors a and b (̸= 0) is then
calculated from

_Q(a, b)_
cos θ = _._ (11)
�Q(a, a) · Q(b, b)

In particular, two vectors a, b are said to be perpendicular to
one another if Q(a, b) = 0. This reminder of the simplest metrical
formulæ of analytical geometry will suffice.
The angle defined by (11) which has been formed by two vectors is shown always to be real by the inequality

_Q[2](a, b) ≤_ _Q(a) · Q(b)_ (12)

which holds for every quadratic form Q which is ≥ 0 for all values
of the argument. It is most simply deduced by forming

_Q(λa + µb) = λ[2]Q(a) + 2λµQ(a, b) + µ[2]Q(b) ≥_ 0.

Since this quadratic form in λ and µ cannot assume both positive
and negative values its “discriminant” Q[2](a, b)−Q(a)·Q(b) cannot
be positive.

From the standpoint of metrical geometry all co-ordinate systems are of equal value. A proof (appealing directly to our geometrical sense) of the theorem that such systems exist will now
be given not only for a “definite” but also for any arbitrary nondegenerate quadratic form, inasmuch as we shall find later in the
theory of relativity that it is just the “indefinite” case that plays
the decisive rôle. We enunciate as follows:—
_Corresponding to every non-degenerate quadratic form Q a co-_
_ordinate system ei can be introduced such that_

_Q(x) = ϵ1x[2]1_ [+][ ϵ][2][x]2[2] [+][ · · ·][ +][ ϵ][n][x]n[2] (ϵi = ±1). (14)

_Proof.—Let us choose any arbitrary vector e1 for which_
_Q(e1) ̸= 0._ By multiplying it by an appropriate positive constant we can arrange so that Q(e1) = ±1. We shall call a vector x
for which Q(e1, x) = 0 orthogonal to e1. If x[∗] is a vector which
is orthogonal to e1, and if x1 is any arbitrary number, then

**x = x1e1 + x[∗]** (15)

satisfies Pythagoras’ Theorem:—

_Q(x) = x[2]1[Q][(][e][1][) + 2][x][1][Q][(][e][1][,][ x][∗][) +][ Q][(][x][∗][) =][ ±][x][2]1_ [+][ Q][(][x][∗][)][.]

The vectors orthogonal to e1 constitute an (n − 1)-dimensional
linear manifold, in which Q(x) is a non-degenerate quadratic
form Since our theorem is self evident for the dimensional


-----

(p y ( )
of n). According to this, n − 1 vectors e2, . . ., en, orthogonal
to e1 exist, such that for

**x[∗]** = x2e2 + · · · + xnen

the relation
_Q(x[∗]) = ±x[2]2_ _[±][ . . .][ ±][ x]n[2]_

holds. This enables Q(x) to be expressed in the required form.
Then
_Q(ei) = ϵi_ _Q(ei, ek) = 0_ (i ̸= k).

These relations result in all the ei’s being independent of one
another and in each vector x being representable in the form (13).
They give
_xi = ϵi · Q(ei, x)._ (16)

An important corollary is to be made in the “indefinite” case.
The numbers r and s attached to the ϵi’s, and having positive
and negative signs respectively, are uniquely determined by the
quadratic form: it may be said to have r positive and s negative
dimensions. (s may be called the inertial index of the quadratic
form, and the theorem just enunciated is known by the name
“Law of Inertia”. The classification of surfaces of the second order depends on it.) The numbers r and s may be characterised
invariantly thus:—
There are r mutually orthogonal vectors e, for which Q(e) > 0;
but for a vector x which is orthogonal to these and not equal to 0,
it necessarily follows that Q(x) < 0. Consequently there cannot
be more than r such vectors. A corresponding theorem holds for s.


-----

q yp g y
tal vectors ei of the co-ordinate system upon which the expression (14) is founded, to which the positive signs ϵi correspond.
The corresponding components xi (i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., r) are definite
linear forms of x [cf. (16)]: xi = Li(x). If, now, ei (i = 1, 2, . . ., r)
is any system of vectors which are mutually orthogonal to one
another, and satisfy the condition Q(ei) > 0, and if x is a vector
orthogonal to these ei, we can set up a linear combination

**y = λ1e1 + . . . + λrer + µx**

in which not all the co-efficients vanish and which satisfies the
_r homogeneous equations_

_L1(y) = 0,_ _. . .,_ _Lr(y) = 0._

It is then evident from the form of the expression that Q(y) must
be negative unless y = 0. In virtue of the formula

_Q(y) −_ �λ[2]1[Q][(][e][1][) +][ · · ·][ +][ λ]r[2][Q][(][e][r][)]� = µ[2]Q(x)

it then follows that Q(x) < 0 except in the case in which if y = 0,
_λ1 = · · · = λr also = 0. But then, by hypothesis, µ must ̸= 0, i.e._
**x = 0.**

In the theory of relativity the case of a quadratic form with one
negative and n − 1 positive dimensions becomes important. In threedimensional space, if we use affine co-ordinates,

into two sheets allows us to draw a distinction between past and future
in the theory of relativity. We shall endeavour to describe this by an
elementary analytical method here instead of using characteristics of
continuity.
Let Q be a non-degenerate quadratic form having only one negative dimension. We choose a vector, for which Q(e) = −1. We shall
call these vectors x, which are not zero and for which Q(x) ≤ 0 “negative vectors”. According to the proof just given for the Theorem of
Inertia, no negative vector can satisfy the equation Q(e, x) = 0. Negative vectors thus belong to one of two classes or “cones” according as
_Q(e, x) < 0 or > 0; e itself belongs to the former class, −e to the latter._
A negative vector x lies “inside” or “on the sheet” of its cone according
as Q(x) < 0 or = 0. To show that the two cones are independent of the
choice of the vector e, one must prove that, from Q(e) = Q(e[′]) = −1,

and Q(x) ≤ 0, it follows that the sign of _[Q][(][e][′][,][ x][)]_

_Q(e, x)_ [is the same as that]

of −Q(e, e[′]).
Every vector x can be resolved into two summands

**x = xe + x[∗]**

such that the first is proportional and the second (x[∗]) is orthogonal
to e. One need only take x = −Q(e, x) and we then get

_Q(x) = −x[2]_ + Q(x[∗]);

_Q(x[∗]) is, as we know, necessarily ≥_ 0. Let us denote it by Q[∗].
The equation

_Q[∗]_ = x[2] + Q(x) = Q[2](e, x) + Q(x)

_Q(x) = −x[2]_ + Q[∗](x) ≤ 0,

_{x = −Q(e, x)};_


_Q(e[′]) = −e[′][2]_ + Q[∗](e[′]) < 0,

_{e[′]_ = −Q(e, e)}.


From the inequality (12) which holds for Q[∗], it follows that

�Q[∗](e[′], x)�2 ≤ _Q∗(e′) · Q∗(x) < e′2x2;_

consequently
_−Q(e[′], x) = e[′]x −_ _Q[∗](e[′], x)_

has the same sign as the first summand e[′]x.

Let us now revert to the case of a definitely positive metrical
groundform with which we are at present concerned. If we use a
Cartesian co-ordinate system to represent a congruent transformation, the co-efficients of transformation αi[k] [in formula][ (5][′][)][, § 2,]
will have to be such that the equation

_ξ1[′][2]_ [+][ ξ]2[′][2] [+][ · · ·][ +][ ξ]n[′][2] [=][ ξ]1[2] [+][ ξ]2[2] [+][ · · ·][ +][ ξ]n[2]

ent transformation is identical with that of its inverse, and since
their product must equal 1, ∆= ±1. The positive or the negative
sign would occur according as the congruence is real or inverted
as in a mirror (“lateral inversion”).
Two possibilities present themselves for the analytical treatment of metrical geometry. **Either one imposes no limitation**
upon the affine co-ordinate system to be used: the problem is
then to develop a theory of invariance with respect to arbitrary
linear transformations, in which, however, in contra-distinction to
the case of affine geometry, we have a definite invariant quadratic

once and for all as an absolute datum. Or, we may use Cartesian co-ordinate systems from the outset: in this case, we are
concerned with a theory of invariance for orthogonal transformations, i.e. linear transformations, in which the co-efficients satisfy
the secondary conditions (17). We must here follow the first course
so as to be able to pass on later to generalisations which extend
beyond the limits of Euclidean geometry. This plan seems advisable from the algebraic point of view, too, since it is easier to
gain a survey of those expressions which remain unchanged for all
linear transformations than of those which are only invariant for
orthogonal transformations (a class of transformations which are
subjected to secondary limitations not easy to define).

An orthogonal transformation is one which is contra-gredient to itself. If we subject a linear form in the variables ξi to any arbitrary
linear transformation the co-efficients become transformed contragrediently to the variables, or they assume a “contra-variant” relationship to these, as it is sometimes expressed.
In an affine co-ordinate system O | e1, e2, . . ., en we have up to
the present characterised a displacement x by the uniquely defined
components ξ[i] given by the equation

**x = ξ[1]e1 + ξ[2]e2 + · · · + ξ[n]en.**

These components thus transform themselves contra-grediently
to the fundamental vectors of the co-ordinate system, and are
related contra-variantly to them; they may thus be more precisely
termed the contra-variant components of the vector x. In
**metrical space, however, we may also characterise a displace-**
ment in relation to the co-ordinate system by the values of its
scalar product with the fundamental vectors ei of the co-ordinate
system
_ξi = (x · ei)._

In passing over into another co-ordinate system these quantities transform themselves—as is immediately evident from their
definition—“co-grediently” to the fundamental vectors (just like
the latter themselves), i.e. in accordance with the equations

In a Cartesian co-ordinate system the co-variant components coincide with the contra-variant components. It must again be emphasised that the contra-variant components alone are at our disposal
in affine space, and that, consequently, wherever in the following
pages we speak of the components of a displacement without specifying them more closely, the contra-variant ones are implied.
Linear forms of one or two arbitrary displacements have already been discussed above. We can proceed from two arguments to three or more. Let us take, for example, a trilinear form
_A(x, y, z). If in an arbitrary co-ordinate system we represent the_
two displacements x, y by their contra-variant components, z by
its co-variant components, i.e. ξ[i], η[i], and ζi respectively, then A is
algebraically expressed as a trilinear form of these three series of
variables with definite number-co-efficients

A connection between the two algebraic trilinear forms (23)
and (23[′]) then exists, by which the one resolves into the other if
the two series of variables ξ η are transformed contra-grediently


-----

p _ik_
of A in the second co-ordinate system if the co-efficients a[l]ik
and also the transformation co-efficient αi[k] [leading from one]
co-ordinate system to the other are known. We have thus arrived
at the conception of the “r-fold co-variant, s-fold contra-variant
tensor of the (r + s)th degree”: it is not confined to metrical
geometry but only assumes the space to be affine. We shall now
give an explanation of this tensor in abstracto. To simplify our
expressions we shall take special values for the numbers r and s
as in the example quoted above: r = 2, s = l, r + s = 3. We
then enunciate:—
_A trilinear form of three series of variables which is depen-_
_dent on the co-ordinate system is called a doubly co-variant, singly_
_contra-variant tensor of the third degree if the above relationship_
_is as follows. The expressions for the linear form in any two co-_
_ordinate systems, viz.:—_

� �
_a[l]ik[ξ][i][η][k][ζ][l][,]_ _a¯[l]ik[ξ][¯][i][η][¯][k][ζ][¯][l]_

_resolve into one another, if two of the series of variables (viz._
_the first two ξ and η) are transformed contra-grediently to the_
_fundamental vectors of the co-ordinate system and the third co-_
_grediently to the same. The co-efficients of the linear form are_
called the components of the tensor in the co-ordinate system in
question. Furthermore, they are called co-variant in the indices,
_i, k, which are associated with the variables to be transformed_
contra-grediently, and contra-variant in the others (here only the
one index l).
The terminology is based upon the fact that the co-efficients
of a uni linear form behave co variantly if the variables are trans


-----

g y y
suffixes to the co-efficients, contra-variant ones written at the top
of the co-efficients. Variables with lowered indices are always to
be transformed co-grediently to the fundamental vectors of the coordinate system, those with raised indices are to be transformed
contra-grediently to the same. A tensor is fully known if its components in a co-ordinate system are given (assuming, of course,
that the co-ordinate system itself is given); these components may,
however, be prescribed arbitrarily. The tensor calculus is concerned with setting out the properties and relations of tensors,
which are independent of the co-ordinate system. In an extended
_sense a quantity in geometry and physics will be called a tensor_
_if it defines uniquely a Linear algebraic form depending on the_
_co-ordinate system in the manner described above; and conversely_
_the tensor is fully characterised if this form is given. For example,_
a little earlier we called a function of three displacements which
depended linearly and homogeneously on each of their arguments
a tensor of the third degree—one which is twofold co-variant and
singly contra-variant. This was possible in metrical space. In
this space, indeed, we are at liberty to represent this quantity by
a “none” fold, single, twofold or threefold co-variant tensor. In
affine space, however, we should only have been able to express it
in the last form as a co-variant tensor of the third degree.
We shall illustrate this general explanation by some examples
in which we shall still adhere to the standpoint of affine geometry
alone.
1. If we represent a displacement a in an arbitrary co-ordinate
system by its (contra-variant) components a[i] and assign to it the
linear form


-----

g _ξi_ y, g
variant tensor of the first order.
From now on we shall no longer use the term “vector” as being
synonymous with “displacement” but to signify a “tensor of the
first order,” so that we shall say, displacements are contra**variant vectors. The same applies to the velocity of a moving**
point, for it is obtained by dividing the infinitely small displacement which the moving point suffers during the time-element dt
by dt (in the limiting case when dt → 0). The present use of
the word vector agrees with its usual significance which includes
not only displacements but also every quantity which, after the
choice of an appropriate unit, can be represented uniquely by a
displacement.
2. It is usually claimed that force has a geometrical character
on the ground that it may be represented in this way. In opposition, however, to this representation there is another which,
we nowadays consider, does more justice to the physical nature
of force, inasmuch as it is based on the conception of work. In
modern physics the conception work is gradually usurping the conception of force, and is claiming a more decisive and fundamental
rôle. We shall define the components of a force in a co-ordinate
system O | ei to be those numbers pi which denote how much work
it performs during each of the virtual displacements ei of its point
of application. These numbers completely characterise the force.
The work performed during the arbitrary displacement

**x = ξ[1]e1 + ξ[2]e2 + · · · + ξ[n]en**

of its point of application is then = [�]i _[p][i][ξ][i][. Hence it follows that]_


-----

y

� �

_piξ[i]_ = _p¯iξ[¯][i]_

_i_ _i_

holds, if the variables ξ[i], as signified by the upper indices, are
transformed contra-grediently with respect to the co-ordinate system. According to this view, then, forces are co-variant vec**tors. The connection between this representation of forces and**
the usual one in which they are displacements will be discussed
when we pass from affine geometry, with which we are at present
dealing, to metrical geometry. The components of a co-variant
vector become transformed co-grediently to the fundamental vectors in passing to a new co-ordinate system.
**Additional Remarks.—Since the transformations of the**
components a[i] of a co-variant vector and of the components b[i]

of a contra-variant vector are contra-gredient to one another,
�i _[a][i][b][i][ is a definite number which is defined by these two vectors]_

and is independent of the co-ordinate system. This is our first
example of an invariant tensor operation. Numbers or scalars are
to be classified as tensors of zero order in the system of tensors.
It has already been explained under what conditions a bilinear
form of two series of variables is called symmetrical and what
makes a symmetrical bilinear form non-degenerate. A bilinear
form F (ξ, η) is called skew-symmetrical if the interchange of
the two sets of variables converts it into its negative, i.e. merely
changes its sign
_F_ (η, ξ) = −F (ξ, η).

This property is expressed in the co-efficients aik by the equations


-----

j p p y
being skew-symmetrical, symmetrical or (symmetrical and) nondegenerate, possessed by co-variant or contra-variant tensors of
the second order is thus independent of the co-ordinate system.
Since the bilinear unit form resolves into itself after a contragredient transformation of the two series of variables there is
among the mixed tensors of the second order (i.e. those which
are simply co-variant and simply contra-variant) one, called the

unit tensor, which has the components δi[k] [= 1 (][i][ =][ k][)]
0 (i ̸= k) [in every]

co-ordinate system.
3. The metrical structure underlying Euclidean space assigns
to every two displacements

� �
**x =** _ξ[i]ei_ **y =** _η[i]ei_

_i_ _i_


a number which is independent of the co-ordinate system and is
their scalar product

**x · y =** � _gikξ[i]η[k]_ _gik = (ei · ek)._

_i,k_

Hence the bilinear form on the right depends on the co-ordinate
system in such a way that a co-variant tensor of the second order
is given by it, viz. the fundamental metrical tensor. The
metrical structure is fully characterised by it. It is symmetrical
and non-degenerate.
4. A linear vector transformation makes any displacement x correspond linearly to another displacement x[′] i e so that


-----

p y
such linear vector transformations, we shall call them matrices.
If the fundamental vectors ei of a co-ordinate system become

�
**e[′]i** [=] _αi[k][e][k]_

_k_

as a result of the transformation it will in general convert the
arbitrary displacement

**x =** � _ξ[i]ei_ into **x[′]** = � _ξ[i]e[′]i_ [=] � _αi[k][ξ][i][e][k][.]_ (24)

_i_ _i_ _i,k_


We may, therefore, characterise the matrix in the particular coordinate system chosen by the bilinear form

�

_a[k]i_ _[ξ][i][η][k][.]_
_i,k_

It follows from (24) that the relation

� �

_a¯[k]i_ _[ξ][¯][i][e][k]_ [=] _a[k]i_ _[ξ][i][e][k]_ [(=][ x][′][)]
_i,k_ _i,k_


holds between two co-ordinate systems (we have used the same
terminology as above) if

� _ξ¯[i]e¯i =_ � _ξ[i]ei (= x);_

_i_ _i_

thus
� _k ¯i_ � _k_ _i_
_ξ_ _ξ_


-----

_η_ g y
and the ξ[i] are transformed contra-grediently to them (the latter
remark about the transformations of the variables is self-evident
so that in future we shall simply omit it in similar cases). In this
way matrices are represented as tensors of the second order. In
particular, the unit tensor corresponds to “identity” which assigns
to every displacement x itself.
As was shown in the examples of force and metrical space it
often happens that the representation of geometrical or physical
quantities by a tensor becomes possible only after a unit measure
has been chosen: this choice can only be made by specifying it in
each particular case. If the unit measure is altered the representative tensors must be multiplied by a universal constant, viz. the
ratio of the two units of measure.
The following criterion is manifestly equivalent to this exposition of the conception tensor. A linear form in several series
_of variables, which is dependent on the co-ordinate system, is_
_a tensor if in every case it assumes a value independent of the_
_co-ordinate system (a) whenever the components of an arbitrary_
_contra-variant vector are substituted for every contra-gredient se-_
_ries of variables, and (b) whenever the components of an arbitrary_
_co-variant vector are substituted for a co-gredient series._
If we now return from affine to metrical geometry, we see
from the arguments at the beginning of the paragraph that the
difference between co-variants and contra-variants which affects
the tensors themselves in affine geometry shrinks to a mere difference in the mode of representation.
Instead of talking of co-variant, mixed, and contra-variant ten_sors we shall hence find it more convenient here to talk only of_


-----

from one tensor to another which has a different character of covariance may be formulated simply as follows. If we interpret the
contra-gredient variables in a tensor as the contra-variant components of an arbitrary displacement, and the co-gredient variables
as co-variant components of an arbitrary displacement, the tensor
becomes transformed into a linear form of several arbitrary displacements which is independent of the co-ordinate system. By
representing the arguments in terms of their co-variant or contravariant components in any way which suggests itself as being appropriate we pass on to other representations of the same tensor. From the purely algebraic point of view the conversion of a
co-variant index into a contra-variant one is performed by substituting new ξi’s for the corresponding variables ξ[i] in the linear
form in accordance with (22). The invariant nature of this process depends on the circumstance that this substitution transforms
contra-gredient variables into co-gredient ones. The converse process is carried out according to the inverse equations(22[′]). The
components themselves are changed (on account of the symmetry
of the gik’s) from contra-variants to co-variants, i.e. the indices
are “lowered” according to the rule:

Substitute ai = � _gija[j]_ for a[i]

_j_

irrespective of whether the numbers a[i] carry any other indices or
not: the raising of the index is effected by the inverse equations.
If, in particular, we apply these remarks to the fundamental
metrical tensor, we get

� _k_ � � _k_ � _ik_
_ξ[i]_ _ξ[i]_ _ξ_ _ξ_


-----

p _k[,]_
components are the co-efficients g[ik] of the equations (22[′]), which
are the inverse of (22). It follows from the symmetry of the tensor
that these as well as the gik’s satisfy the condition of symmetry
_g[ki]_ = g[ik].
With regard to notation we shall adopt the convention of denoting the co-variant, mixed, and contra-variant components of
the same tensor by similar letters, and of indicating by the position of the index at the top or bottom respectively whether the
components are contra-variant or co-variant with respect to the
index, as is shown in the following example of a tensor of the
second order:
� � � �

_aikξ[i]η[k]_ = _a[i]k[ξ][i][η][k][ =]_ _a[k]i_ _[ξ][i][η][k]_ [=] _a[ik]ξiηk_
_i,k_ _i,k_ _i,k_ _i,k_

(in which the variables with lower and upper indices are connected
in pairs by (22)).
In metrical space it is clear, from what has been said, that
the difference between a co-variant and a contra-variant vector
disappears: in this case we can represent a force, which, according
to our view, is by nature a co-variant vector, as a contra-variant
vector, too, i.e. by a displacement. For, as we represented it above
by the linear form [�]i _[p][i][ξ][i][ in the contra-gredient variables][ ξ][i][, we]_

can now transform the latter by means of (22[′]) into one having
co-gredient variables ξi, viz. [�]i _[p][i][ξ][i][. We then have]_

� � � �

_p[i]ξi =_ _gikp[i]ξ[k]_ = _gikp[k]ξ[i]_ = _piξ[i];_
_i_ _i,k_ _i,k_ _i_

the representative displacement p is thus defined by the fact that
the work which the force performs during an arbitrary displace

1 (i = k),
0 (i ̸= k),


the connecting equations (22) are simply: ξi = ξ[i]. If we confine
ourselves to the use of Cartesian co-ordinate systems, the difference between co-variants and contra-variants ceases to exist, not
only for tensors but also for the tensor components. It must, however, be mentioned that the conceptions which have so far been
outlined concerning the fundamental tensor gik assume only that
it is symmetrical and non-degenerate, whereas the introduction of
a Cartesian co-ordinate system implies, in addition, that the corresponding quadratic form is definitely positive. This entails a difference. In the Theory of Relativity the time co-ordinate is added
as a fully equivalent term to the three-space co-ordinates, and
the measure-relation which holds in this four-dimensional manifold is not based on a definite form but on an indefinite one
(Chapter III). In this manifold, therefore, we shall not be able to
introduce a Cartesian co-ordinate system if we restrict ourselves
to real co-ordinates; but the conceptions here developed which
are to be worked out in detail for the dimensional number n = 4
may be applied without alteration. Moreover, the algebraic simplicity of this calculus advises us against making exclusive use of
Cartesian co-ordinate systems, as we have already mentioned at
the end of § 4. Above all, finally, it is of great importance for
later extensions which take us beyond Euclidean geometry that
the affine view should even at this stage receive full recognition

tensors: this expresses the mathematical constitution of the space
in which these quantities exist. The mathematical symmetry
which this conditions is by no means restricted to geometry but,
on the contrary, attains its full validity in physics. As natural
phenomena take place in a metrical space this tensor calculus is
the natural mathematical instrument for expressing the uniformity underlying them.

**§ 6. Tensor Algebra. Examples**

**Addition of Tensors.—The multiplication of a linear form,**
bilinear form, trilinear form . . . by a number, likewise the addition
of two linear forms, or of two bilinear forms . . . always gives rise
to a form of the same kind. Vectors and tensors may thus be
multiplied by a number (a scalar), and two or more tensors of the
same order may be added together. These operations are carried
out by multiplying the components by the number in question or
by addition, respectively. Every set of tensors of the same order
contains a unique tensor 0, of which all the components vanish,
and which, when added to any tensor of the same order, leaves
the latter unaltered. The state of a physical system is described
by specifying the values of certain scalars and tensors.
The fact that a tensor which has been derived from them by
mathematical operations and is an invariant (i.e. dependent upon
them alone and not upon the choice of the co-ordinate system) is
equal to zero is what, in general, the expression of a physical law
amounts to.
**Examples.—The motion of a point is represented analytically**

respectively, as functions of the time t. The derivatives dt are

the contra-variant components u[i] of the vector “velocity”. By multiplying it by the mass m of the moving-point, m being a scalar
which serves to express the inertia of matter, we get the “impulse”
(or “momentum”). By adding the impulses of several points of
mass or of those, respectively, of which one imagines a rigid body
to be composed in the mechanics of point-masses, we get the total
impulse of the point-system or of the rigid body. In the case of
continuously extended matter we must supplant these sums by
integrals. The fundamental law of motion is

_dG[i]_

_G[i]_ = mu[i] (25)
_dt_ [=][ p][i][;]


where G[i] denote the contra-variant components of the impulse of
a mass-point and p[i] denote those of the force.
Since, according to our view, force is primarily a co-variant
vector, this fundamental law is possible only in a metrical space,
but not in a purely affine one. The same law holds for the total
impulse of a rigid body and for the total force acting on it.

In the same way we may multiply a tensor of the first order by
one of the second order (or generally, a tensor of any order by a
tensor of any order). By multiplying

� _aiξ[i]_ by � _b[k]i_ _[η][i][ζ][k]_

in which the Greek letters denote variables which are to be transformed contra-grediently or co-grediently according as the indices

_aib[l]k[ξ][i][η][k][ζ][l]_
_i,k,l_


and, accordingly, by multiplying the two tensors of the first and
second order, a tensor c of the third order, i.e.

_ai · b[l]k_ [=][ c]ik[l] _[.]_

This multiplication is performed on the components by merely
multiplying each component of one tensor by each component of
the other, as is evident above. It must be noted that the covariant components (with respect to the index l, for example) of
the resultant tensor of the third order, i.e. c[l]ik [=][ a][i][b]k[l] [, are given by:]
_cikl = aibkl. It is thus immediately permissible in such multipli-_

**sors.—If two vectors with the contra-variant components a[i], b[i],**
are multiplied first in one order and then in the reverse order, and
if we then subtract the one result from the other, we get a skewsymmetrical tensor c of the second order with the contra-variant
components
_c[ik]_ = a[i]b[k] _−_ _a[k]b[i]._

This tensor occurs in ordinary vector analysis as the “vectorial
product” of the two vectors a and b. By specifying a certain direction of twist in three-dimensional space, it becomes possible
to establish a reversible one-to-one correspondence between these
tensors and the vectors. (This is impossible in four-dimensional
space for the obvious reason that, in it, a skew-symmetrical tensor
of the second order has six independent components, whereas a
vector has only four; similarly in the case of spaces of still higher
dimensions.) In three-dimensional space the above method of representation is founded on the following. If we use only Cartesian
co-ordinate systems and introduce in addition to a and b an arbitrary displacement ξ, the determinant

_a[1]_ _a[2]_ _a[3]_

_b[1]_ _b[2]_ _b[3]_ = c[23]ξ[1] + c[31]ξ[2] + c[12]ξ[3]

_ξ[1]_ _ξ[2]_ _ξ[3]_

������ ������

becomes multiplied by the determinant of the co-efficients of transformation, when we pass from one co-ordinate system to another.
In the case of orthogonal transformations this determinant = ±1.
If we confine our attention to “proper” orthogonal transformations,
i.e. such for which this determinant = +1 the above linear form
in the ξ’s remains unchanged. Accordingly, the formulæ

vector c[∗], this relation being invariant for proper orthogonal transformations. The vector c[∗] is perpendicular to the two vectors
_a and b, and its magnitude (according to elementary formulæ of_
analytical geometry) is equal to the area of the parallelogram of
which the sides are a and b. It may be justifiable on the ground
of economy of expression to replace skew-symmetrical tensors by
vectors in ordinary vector analysis, but in some ways it hides the
essential feature; it gives rise to the well-known “swimming-rules”
in electrodynamics, which in no wise signify that there is a unique
direction of twist in the space in which electrodynamics events
occur; they become necessary only because the magnetic intensity of field is regarded as a vector, whereas it is, in reality, a
skew-symmetrical tensor (like the so-called vectorial product of
two vectors). If we had been given one more space-dimension,
this error could never have occurred.
In mechanics the skew-symmetrical tensor product of two vectors occurs—
1. As moment of momentum (angular momentum) about a
point O. If there is a point-mass at P and if ξ[1], ξ[2], ξ[3] are the
components of _[−→]OP and u[i]_ are the (contra-variant) components of
the velocity of the points at the moment under consideration, and
_m its mass, the momentum of momentum is defined by_

_L[ik]_ = m(u[i]ξ[k] _−_ _u[k]ξ[i])._

The moment of momentum of a rigid body about a point O is the
sum of the moments of momentum of each of the point-masses of
the body.

The turning-moment of a system of forces is obtained by simple
addition. In addition to (25) the law

_dt_


holds for a point-mass as well as for a rigid body free from constraint. The turning-moment of a rigid body about a fixed point O
is governed by the law (27) alone.
A further example of a skew-symmetrical tensor is the rate
**of rotation (angular velocity) of a rigid body about the fixed**
point O. If this rotation about O brings the point P in general
to P _[′], the vector_ _[−−→]OP_ _[′]_ is produced, and hence also PP _[′], by a_
linear transformation from _[−→]OP_ . If ξ[i] are the components of _[−→]OP_,

i.e. the tensor which has vik for its co-variant components is skewsymmetrical.
A rigid body in motion experiences an infinitely small rotation during an infinitely small element of time δt. We need only
to divide by δt the infinitesimal rotation-tensor v just formed to
derive (in the limit when δt → 0) the skew-symmetrical tensor
“angular velocity,” which we shall again denote by v. If u[i] signify
the contra-variant components of the velocity of the point P, and

rotation of a body offers a simple example of a symmetrical tensor
of the second order.
If a point-mass of mass m is situated at the point P to which
the vector _[−→]OP starting from the centre of rotation O and with the_
components ξ[i] leads, we call the symmetrical tensor of which the
contra-variant components are given by mξ[i]ξ[k] (multiplication!),
the “inertia of rotation” of the point-mass (with respect to the
centre of rotation O). The inertia of rotation T _[ik]_ of a point-system
or body is defined as the sum of these tensors formed separately
for each of its points P . This definition is different from the usual
one, but is the correct one if the intention of regarding the velocity
of rotation as a skew-symmetrical tensor and not as a vector is to
be carried out, as we shall presently see. The tensor T _[ik]_ plays
the same part with regard to a rotation about O as that of the
scalar m in translational motion.
**Contraction.—If a[k]i** [are the mixed components of a tensor]

The invariant [�]i _[a]i[i]_ [which has been formed from the compo-]

nents a[k]i [of a matrix is called the][ trace (spur) of the matrix][.]
This theorem enables us immediately to carry out a general
operation on tensors, called “contraction,” which takes a second
place to multiplication. By making a definite upper index in the
mixed components of a tensor coincide with a definite lower one,
and summing over this index, we derive from the given tensor a
new one the order of which is two less than that of the original
one, e.g. we get from the components a[lm]hik [of a tensor of the fifth]
order a tensor of the third order, thus:—

_a¯[lr]hir_ [= ¯][c]hi[l] _[.]_ (31)

To see this we only need the help of two arbitrary contra-variant
vectors ξ[i], η[i] and a co-variant one ζi. By means of them we form
the components,
�

_a[lm]hik[ξ][h][η][i][ζ][l]_ [=][ f]k[ m][,]
_h,i,l_

of a mixed tensor of the second order: to this we apply the theorem

� _fr[r]_ [=] � _f¯r[r]_

_r_ _r_


which was just proved. We then get the formula

_c[l]hi[ξ][h][η][i][ζ][l]_ [=] _c¯[l]hi[ξ][¯][h][η][¯][i][ζ][¯][l]_
_h,i,l_ _h,i,l_

in which the c’s are defined by (30), the ¯c’s by (31). The ¯c[l]hi[’s are]
thus, in point of fact, the components of the same tensor of the
third order in the new system, of which the components in the old
one = c[l]ih[.]
**Examples of this process of contraction have been met with**
in abundance in the above. Wherever summation took place with
respect to certain indices, the summation index appeared twice in
the general member of summation, once above and once below the
co-efficient: each such summation was an example of contraction.
For example, in formula (29): by multiplication of vik with ξ[i] one
can form the tensor vikξ[l] of the third order; by making k coincide
with l and summing for k we get the contracted tensor of the first

**x[′′]** = −B(x[′]), a combination BA results from the two matrices,
which transforms x directly into x[′′] = BA(x). If A has the components a[k]i [and][ B][ components][ b]i[k][, the components of the combined]
matrix BA are
�
_c[k]i_ [=] _b[r]i_ _[a][k]r_ _[.]_

_r_

Here, again, we have the case of multiplication followed by contraction.
The process of contraction may be applied simultaneously for
several pairs of indices. From the tensors of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . .
order with the co-variant components ai, aik, aikl, . . ., we thus
get, in particular, the invariants

� � �

_aia[i],_ _aika[ik],_ _aikla[ikl], . . . ._
_i_ _i,k_ _i,k,l_

If, as is here assumed, the quadratic form corresponding to the
fundamental metrical tensor is definitely positive, these invariants
are all positive, for, in a Cartesian co-ordinate system they disclose
themselves directly as the sums of the squares of the components.
Just as in the simplest case of a vector, the square root of these
invariants may be termed the measure or the magnitude of the
tensor of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . order.
We shall at this point make the convention, once and for all,
that if an index occurs twice (once above and once below) in a
term of a formula to which indices are attached, this is always to
signify that summation is to be carried out with respect to the
index in question, and we shall not consider it necessary to put a

only require affine geometry: they are not based upon a “fundamental metrical tensor”. The latter is only necessary for the
process of passing from co-variant to contra-variant components
and the reverse.

**Euler’s Equations for a Spinning Top**

As an exercise in tensor calculus, we shall deduce Euler’s equations for the motion of a rigid body under no forces about a fixed
point O. We write the fundamental equations (27) in the covariant form
_dLik_

= 0
_dt_

and multiply them, for the sake of briefness, by the contra-variant
components w[ik] of an arbitrary skew-symmetrical tensor which is
constant (independent of the time), and apply contraction with
respect to i and k. If we put Hik equal to the sum

�

_muiξ[k]_
_m_

which is to be taken over all the points of mass, we get

1
2 _[L][ik][w][ik][ =][ H][ik][w][ik][ =][ H,]_

an invariant, and we can compress our equation into

_dH_

(32)
_dt_ [= 0][.]

If we introduce the expressions (29) for ui, and the tensor of inertia T then


-----

y
fixed in space has been used. The components T of inertia then
change with the distribution of matter in the course of time. If,
however, in place of this we use a co-ordinate system which is fixed
in the body, and consider the symbols so far used as referring to
the components of the corresponding tensors with respect to this
co-ordinate system, whereas we distinguish the components of the
same tensors with respect to the co-ordinate system fixed in space
by a horizontal bar, the equation (32) remains valid on account
of the invariance of H. The Ti[k][’s are now constants; on the other]
hand, however, the w[ik]’s vary with the time. Our equation gives
us
_dHik_

_· w[ik]_ + Hik · _[dw][ik]_ = 0. (34)
_dt_ _dt_

To determine _[dw][ik]_

_dt_ [, we choose two arbitrary vectors fixed in]
the body, of which the co-variant components in the co-ordinate
system attached to the body are ξi and ηi respectively. These
quantities are thus constants, but their components _ξ[¯]i, ¯ηi in the_
space co-ordinate system are functions of the time. Now,

_w[ik]ξiηk = ¯w[ik][ ¯]ξiη¯k,_

and hence, differentiating with respect to the time


_dw[ik]_ � _dξ¯i_

g g ( )

_w¯[ik](¯vi[r][ξ][¯][r][η][¯][k]_ [+ ¯][v]k[r][ξ][¯][i][η][¯][r][)][,]

and as this is an invariant, we may remove the bars, obtaining

_dw[ik]_
_ξiηk_ = w[ik](ξrηkvi[r] [+][ ξ][i][η][r][v]k[r][)][.]

_dt_


This holds identically in ξ and η; thus if the H _[ik]_ are arbitrary
numbers,

_dw[ik]_
_Hik_ = w[ik](vi[r][H][rk] [+][ v]k[r][H][ir][)][.]

_dt_

If we take the Hik’s to be the quantities which we denoted above
by this symbol, the second term of (34) is determined, and our
equation becomes

�dHik �

+ (vi[r][H][rk] [+][ v]k[r][H][ir][)] _w[ik]_ = 0,

which is an identity in the skew-symmetrical tensor w[ik]; hence

We shall now substitute the expression (33) for Hik. Since, on
account of the symmetry of Tik,

_vk[r][H][ir][(=][ v]k[r][v]i[s][T][rs][)]_

is also symmetrical in i and k, the two last terms of the sum
in the square brackets destroy one another. If we now put the
symmetrical tensor

It is well known that we may introduce a Cartesian co-ordinate
system composed of the three principal axes of inertia, so that in
these


_gik =_

1 (i = k),
and _Tik = 0_ (for i ̸= k).
0 (i ̸= k),


If we then write T1 in place of T1[1][, and do the same for the re-]
maining indices, our equations in this co-ordinate system assume
the simple form

(Ti + Tk)[dv][ik]

_dt_ [= (][T][k][ −] _[T][i][)(][v, v][)][ik][.]_

These are the differential equations for the components vik of the
unknown angular velocity—equations which, as is known, may
be solved in elliptic functions of t. The principal moments of
inertia Ti which occur here are connected with those, Ti[∗][, given in]
accordance with the usual definitions by the equations

_T1[∗]_ [=][ T][2] [+][ T][3][,] _T2[∗]_ [=][ T][3] [+][ T][1][,] _T3[∗]_ [=][ T][1] [+][ T][2][.]

The above treatment of the problem of rotation may, in contradistinction to the usual method, be transposed, word for word,
from three-dimensional space to multi-dimensional spaces. This is,
indeed, irrelevant in practice. On the other hand, the fact that we

p y y
that the dimensional number appears accidental in them, gives
us an assurance that we have succeeded fully in grasping them
mathematically.
The study of tensor-calculus[∗] is, without doubt, attended by
conceptual difficulties—over and above the apprehension inspired
by indices, which must be overcome. From the formal aspect,
however, the method of reckoning used is of extreme simplicity;
it is much easier than, e.g., the apparatus of elementary vectorcalculus. There are two operations, multiplication and contraction; then putting the components of two tensors with totally
different indices alongside of one another; the identification of an
upper index with a lower one, and, finally, summation (not expressed) over this index. Various attempts have been made to
set up a standard terminology in this branch of mathematics involving only the vectors themselves and not their components,
analogous to that of vectors in vector analysis. This is highly
expedient in the latter, but very cumbersome for the much more
complicated framework of the tensor calculus. In trying to avoid
continual reference to the components we are obliged to adopt an
endless profusion of names and symbols in addition to an intricate set of rules for carrying out calculations, so that the balance
of advantage is considerably on the negative side. An emphatic
protest must be entered against these orgies of formalism which
are threatening the peace of even the technical scientist.

**§** **y** **p**

It is obvious from the examples of the preceding paragraph
that symmetrical and skew-symmetrical tensors of the second order, wherever they are applied, represent entirely different kinds of
quantities. Accordingly the character of a quantity is not in general described fully, if it is stated to be a tensor of such and such
an order, but symmetrical characteristics have to be added.
A linear form of several series of variables is called symmet**rical if it remains unchanged after any two of these series of vari-**
ables are interchanged, but is called skew-symmetrical if this
converts it into its negative, i.e. reverses its sign. A symmetrical
linear form does not change if the series of variables are subjected
to any permutations among themselves; a skew-symmetrical one
does not change if an even permutation is carried out with the
series of variables, but changes its sign if the permutation is odd.
The co-efficients aikl of a symmetrical trilinear form (we purposely
choose three again as an example) satisfy the conditions

_aikl = akli = alik = akil = alki = ailk._

Of the co-efficients of a skew-symmetrical tensor only those which
have three different indices can be ̸= 0 and they satisfy the equations
_aikl = akli = alik = −akil = −alki = −ailk._

There can consequently be no (non-vanishing) skew-symmetrical forms of more than n series of variables in a domain of n variables. Just as a symmetrical bilinear form may be entirely replaced by the quadratic form which is derived from it by identify

-----

q y y g
ables with the co-efficients aikl, which is derived from the trilinear
form by the same process. If in a skew-symmetrical trilinear form

�
_F =_ _aiklξ[i]η[k]ζ_ _[l]_

_i,k,l_


we perform the 3! permutations on the series of variables ξ, η, ζ,
and prefix a positive or negative sign to each according as the
permutation is even or odd, we get the original form six times.
If they are all added together, we get the following scheme for
them:—

_ξ[i]_ _ξ[k]_ _ξ[l]_

�

_F =_ [1] _aikl_ _η[i]_ _η[k]_ _η[l]_ _._ (36)

3!

_ζ_ _[i]_ _ζ_ _[k]_ _ζ_ _[l]_

������ ������

In a linear form the property of being symmetrical or skewsymmetrical is not destroyed if each series of variables is subjected
to the same linear transformation. Consequently, a meaning may
be attached to the terms symmetrical and skew-symmetrical,
**co-variant or contra-variant tensors.** But these expressions
have no meaning in the domain of mixed tensors. We need spend
no further time on symmetrical tensors, but must discuss skewsymmetrical co-variant tensors in somewhat greater detail as they
have a very special significance.
The components ξ[i] of a displacement determine the direction
of a straight line (positive or negative) as well as its magnitude.
If ξ[i] and η[i] are any two linearly independent displacements, and
if they are marked out from any arbitrary point O, they trace out
a plane. The ratios of the quantities


-----

p p ( p )
the same way as the ratios of the ξ[i] fix the position of a straight
line (its “direction”). The ξ[ik] are each = 0 if, and only if, the two
displacements ξ[i], η[i] are linearly dependent; in this case they do
not map out a two-dimensional manifold. When two linearly independent displacements ξ[i] and η[i] trace out a plane, a definite sense
of rotation is implied, viz. the sense of the rotation about O in
the plane which for a turn < 180[◦] brings ξ to coincide with η; also
a definite measure (quantity), viz. the area of the parallelogram
enclosed by ξ and η. If we mark off two displacements ξ, η from
an arbitrary point O, and two ξ, η from an arbitrary point O,
_∗_ _∗_ _∗_
then the position, the sense of rotation, and the magnitude of the
plane marked out are identical in each if, and only if, the ξ[ik]’s of
the one pair coincide with those of the other, i.e.

_ξ[i]η[k]_ _−_ _ξ[k]η[i]_ = ξ[i]
_∗[η]∗[k]_ _[−]_ _[ξ]∗[k][η]∗[i]_ _[.]_

So that just as the ξ[i]’s determine the direction and length of
a straight line, so the ξ[ik]’s determine the sense and surface area
of a plane; the completeness of the analogy is evident.
To express this we may call the first configuration a one**dimensional space-element, the second a two-dimensional**
**space-element. Just as the square of the magnitude of a one-**
dimensional space-element is given by the invariant

_ξiξ[i]_ = gikξ[i]ξ[k] = Q(ξ)

so the square of the magnitude of the two-dimensional spaceelement is given, in accordance with the formulæ of analytical
geometry by

In the same sense the determinants

are the components of a three-dimensional space-element, the
magnitude of which is given by the square root of the invariant

1
3! _[ξ][ikl][ξ][ikl][.]_

In three-dimensional space this invariant is

_ξ123ξ[123]_ = g1ig2kg3lξ[ikl]ξ[123],

and since ξ[ikl] = ±ξ[123], according as ikl is an even or an odd
permutation of 123, it assumes the value

_g · (ξ[123])[2]_

where g is the determinant of the co-efficients gik of the fundamental metrical form. The volume of the parallelepiped thus becomes

In a space of more than three dimensions we may similarly pass
on to four-dimensional space-elements, etc.
Just as a co-variant tensor of the first order assigns a number linearly (and independently of the co-ordinate system) to every one-dimensional space-element (i.e. displacement), so a skewsymmetrical co-variant tensor of the second order assigns a number to every two-dimensional space-element, a skew-symmetrical
tensor of the third order to each three-dimensional space-element,
and so on: this is immediately evident from the form in which
(36) is expressed. For this reason we consider it justifiable to call
the co-variant skew-symmetrical tensors simply linear tensors.
Among operations in the domain of linear tensors we shall mention
the two following ones:—

_aibk −_ _akbi = cik,_ (37)
_aibkl −_ _akbli + albik = cikl._ (38)

The former produces a linear tensor of the second order from two
linear tensors of the first order; the latter produces a linear tensor
of the third order from one of the first and one of the second.
Sometimes conditions of symmetry more complicated than
those considered heretofore occur. In the realm of quadrilinear
forms F (ξ, η, ξ[′], η[′]) those play a particular part which satisfy the
conditions

_F_ (η, ξ, ξ[′], η[′]) = F (ξ, η, η[′], ξ[′]) = −F (ξ, η, ξ[′], η[′]), (391)
_F_ (ξ[′], η[′], ξ, η) = F (ξ, η, ξ[′], η[′]), (392)
_F_ (ξ η ξ[′] _η[′]) + F_ (ξ ξ[′] _η[′]_ _η) + F_ (ξ η[′] _η ξ[′]) = 0_ (393)


-----

y y q y
two-dimensional space-element

_ξ[ik]_ = ξ[i]η[k] _−_ _ξ[k]η[i]_

there is one and only one quadrilinear form F which satisfies these
conditions of symmetry, and from which the above quadratic form
is derived by identifying the second pair of variables ξ[′], η[′] with
the first pair ξ, η. We must consequently use co-variant tensors
of the fourth order having the symmetrical properties (39) if we
wish to represent functions which stand in quadratic relationship
with an element of surface.
The most general form of the condition of symmetry
for a tensor F of the fifth order of which the first, second, and
fourth series of variables are contra-gredient, the third and fifth
co-gredient (we are taking a particular case) are

�

_eSFS = 0_
_S_

in which S signifies all permutations of the five series of variables in which the contra-gredient ones are interchanged among
themselves and likewise the co-gredient ones; FS denotes the form
which results from F after the permutation S; eS is a system of
definite numbers, which are assigned to the permutations S. The
summation is taken over all the permutations S. The kind of symmetry underlying a definite type of tensors expresses itself in one
or more of such conditions of symmetry.

**§ 8. Tensor Analysis. Stresses**

Quantities which describe how the state of a spatially extended


-----

y p g g y
“functions of the place or point”. According as we are dealing with
a scalar, vector, or tensor, we speak of a scalar, vector, or tensor
**field.**
Such a field is given if a scalar, vector, or tensor of the proper
type is assigned to every point of space or to a definite region of
it. If we use a definite co-ordinate system the value of the scalar
quantities or of the components of the vector or tensor quantities
respectively, appear in the co-ordinate system as functions of the
co-ordinates of a variable point in the region under consideration.
Tensor analysis tells us how, by differentiating with respect to
the space co-ordinates, a new tensor can be derived from the old
one in a manner entirely independent of the co-ordinate system.
This method, like tensor algebra, is of extreme simplicity. Only
one operation occurs in it, viz. differentiation.
If
_φ = f_ (x1, x2, . . ., xn) = f (x)

denotes a given scalar field, the change of φ corresponding to an
infinitesimal displacement of the variable point, in which its coordinates xi suffer changes dxi respectively, is given by the total
differential

_df =_ _[∂f]_ _dx1 +_ _[∂f]_ _dx2 + · · · +_ _[∂f]_ _dxn._

_∂x1_ _∂x2_ _∂xn_


This formula signifies that if the ∆xi are first taken as the components of a finite displacement and the ∆f are the corresponding
changes in f, then the difference between

�

_i_


_∂f_
_ξ[i]_
_∂xi_


in the variables ξ[i] to this differential. If we carry out the same construction in another co-ordinate system (with horizontal bars over
the co-ordinates), it is evident from the meaning of the term differential that the first linear form passes into the second, if the ξ[i]’s
are subjected to the transformation which is contra-gredient to
the fundamental vectors. Accordingly

_∂f_ _∂f_ _∂f_
_,_ _, . . .,_
_∂x1_ _∂x2_ _∂xn_

are the co-variant components of a vector which arises from the
scalar field φ in a manner independent of the co-ordinate system.
In ordinary vector analysis it occurs as the gradient and is denoted by the symbol grad φ.
This operation may immediately be transposed from a scalar
to any arbitrary tensor field. If, e.g., fik[h] [(][x][)][ are components of a]
tensor field of the third order, contra-variant with respect to h,
but co-variant with respect to i and k, then

_fik[h]_ _[ξ][h][η][i][ζ]_ _[k]_

is an invariant, if we take ξh as standing for the components of
an arbitrary but constant co variant vector (i e independent of

_∂fik[h]_ _ξhη[i]ζ_ _[k]_ _dxl_
_∂xl_

hence

_fikl[h]_ [=] _[∂f]ik[ h]_
_∂xl_
are the components of a tensor field of the fourth order, which
arises from the given one in a manner independent of the coordinate system. Just this is the process of differentiation;
as is seen, it raises the order of the tensor by 1. We have still to
remark that, on account of the circumstance that the fundamental
metrical tensor is independent of its position, one obtains the
components of the tensor just formed, for example, which are
contra-variant with respect to the index k, by transposing the

index k under the sign of differentiation to the top, viz. _[∂f][ hki]_ . The

change from co-variant to contra-variant is interchangeable with
differentiation. Differentiation may be carried out purely formally
by imagining the tensor in question multiplied by a vector having

hand the quantities

are the co-variant components of a symmetrical tensor of the second order. If the vector u represents the velocity of continuously

of this tensor at a point signifies that the immediate neighbourhood of the point moves as a rigid body; it thus merits the name

Tensor (41), i.e. the curl, vanishes if vi is the gradient of a scalar
field; tensor (42) vanishes if vik is the curl of a vector ui.
**Stresses.—An important example of a tensor field is offered**
by the stresses occurring in an elastic body; it is, indeed, from
this example that the name “tensor” has been derived. When tensile or compressional forces act at the surface of an elastic body,
whilst, in addition, “volume-forces” (e.g. gravitation) act on various portions of the matter within the body, a state of equilibrium
establishes itself, in which the forces of cohesion called up in the
matter by the distortion balance the impressed forces from without. If we imagine any portion J of the matter cut out of the
body and suppose it to remain coherent after we have removed
the remaining portion, the impressed volume forces will not of
themselves keep this piece of matter in a state of equilibrium.
They are, however, balanced by the compressional forces acting
on the surface Ω of the portion J, which are exerted on it by the
portion of matter removed. We have actually, if we do not take
the atomic (granular) structure of matter into account, to imagine
that the forces of cohesion are only active in direct contact, with
the consequence that the action of the removed portion upon J
must be representable by superficial forces such as pressure: and
indeed, if S do is the pressure acting on an element of surface do
(S here denotes the pressure per unit surface), S can depend only
upon the place at which the element of surface do happens to be

We shall use Cartesian co-ordinates x1, x2, x3. The compressional forces per unit of area at a point, which act on an element

coincide with the direction of the positive x1-, x2-, x3-axis respectively will be denoted by S1, S2, S3. We now choose any three
positive numbers a1, a2, a3, and a positive number ϵ, which is to
converge to the value 0 (whereas the ai remain fixed). From the
point O under consideration we mark off in the direction of the
positive co-ordinate axes the distances

_OP1 = ϵa1,_ _OP2 = ϵa2,_ _OP3 = ϵa3_

and consider the infinitesimal tetrahedron OP1P2P3 having
_OP2P3, OP3P1, OP1P2 as walls and P1P2P3 as its “roof”._ If
_f is the superficial area of the roof and a1, a2, a3 are the direction_
cosines of its inward normals n, then the areas of the walls are

_−f · a1(=_ [1]2 _[ϵ][2][a][2][a][3][)][,]_ _−f · a2,_ _−f · a3._

The sum of the pressures on the walls and the roof becomes for
evanescent values of ϵ:

_f_ �Sn − (a1S1 + a2S2 + a3S3)�.

The magnitude of f is of the order ϵ[2]: but the volume force acting
upon the volume of the tetrahedron is only of the order of magni

**Sn = (a1S1 + a2S2 + a3S3).**

With the help of (43) this formula may be extended immediately
to the case in which the tetrahedron is situated in any of the remaining 7 octants. If we call the components of Si with respect to
the co-ordinate axes Si1, Si2, Si3, and if ξ[i], η[i] are the components
of any two arbitrary displacements of length 1, then

�

_Sikξ[i]η[k]_ (44)

_i,k_

is the component, in the direction η, of the compressional force
which is exerted on an element of surface of which the inner normal
is ξ. The bilinear form (44) has thus a significance independent
of the co-ordinate system, and the Sik’s are the components of
a “stress” tensor field. We shall continue to operate in rectangular co-ordinate systems so that we shall not have to distinguish
between co-variant and contra-variant quantities.
We form the vector S[′]1 [having components][ S][1][i][,][ S][2][i][,][ S][3][i][. The]
component of S[′]1 [in the direction of the inward normal][ n][ of an]
element of surface is then equal to the x1-component of Sn. The
_x1-component of the total pressure which acts on the surface Ω_ of
the detached portion of matter J is therefore equal to the surface
integral of the normal components of S[′]1 [and this, by Gauss’s]
Theorem, is equal to the volume integral

Accordingly, if we form the x2 and x3 components in addition to
the x1 component, this condition of equilibrium gives us

i.e. the symmetry of the stress-tensor S. For an arbitrary displacement having the components ξ[i],

As a result of the foregoing reasoning we have formulated in
exact terms the conception of stress alone, and have discovered
how to represent it mathematically. To set up the fundamental
laws of the theory of elasticity it is, in addition, necessary to find
out how the stresses depend on the distortion brought about in
the matter by the impressed forces. There is no occasion for us to
discuss this in greater detail.

**§ 9. Stationary Electromagnetic Fields**

Hitherto, whenever we have spoken of mechanical or physical
things, we have done so for the purpose of showing in what manner
their spatial nature expresses itself: namely, that its laws manifest
themselves as invariant tensor relations. This also gave us an opportunity of demonstrating the importance of the tensor calculus
by giving concrete examples of it. It enabled us to prepare the
ground for later discussions which will grapple with physical theories in greater detail, both for the sake of the theories themselves
and for their important bearing on the problem of time. In this
connection the theory of the electromagnetic field which is

Coulomb’s Law for electrostatics may be enunciated thus. If
any charges of electricity are distributed in space with the density ρ they exert a force

**K = e · E** (48)

upon a point-charge e, whereby

� _ρ · r_
**E = −** (49)
4πr[3][ dV.]

**r here denotes the vector** _[−→]OP which leads from the “point of emer-_
gence O” at which E is to be determined, to the “current point” or
source, with respect to which the integral is taken: r is its length
and dV is the element of volume. The force is thus composed of
two factors, the charge e of the small testing body, which depends
on its condition alone, and of the “intensity of field” E, which on
the contrary is determined solely by the given distribution of the
charges in space. We picture in our minds that even if we do not
observe the force acting on a testing body, an “electric field” is
called up by the charges distributed in space, this field being described by the vector E; the action on a point-charge e expresses
itself in the force (48). We may derive E from a potential −φ in
accordance with the formulæ

From (50) it follows (1) that E is an irrotational (and hence lamel

is the source of the electric field; i.e. in formulæ

curl E = 0, div E = ρ. (51)

Inversely, Coulomb’s Law arises out of these simple differential
laws if we add the condition that the field E vanish at infinite
distances. For if we put E = grad φ from the first of the equations (51), we get from the second, to determine φ, Poisson’s equation ∆φ = ρ, the solution of which is given by (50).
Coulomb’s Law deals with “action at a distance”. The intensity of the field at a point is expressed by it depending on
the charges at all other points, near or far, in space. In contradistinction from this the far simpler formulæ (51) express laws
relating to “infinitely near” action. As a knowledge of the values
of a function in an arbitrarily small region surrounding a point
is sufficient to determine the differential quotient of the function
at the point, the values of ρ and E at a point and in its immediate neighbourhood are brought into connection with one another
by (51). We shall regard these laws of infinitely near action as
the true expression of the uniformity of action in nature, whereas
we look upon (49) merely as a mathematical result following logically from it. In the light of the laws expressed by (51) which have
such a simple intuitional significance we believe that we under**stand the source of Coulomb’s Law. In doing this we do indeed**
bow to dictates of the theory of knowledge. Even Leibniz formulated the postulate of continuity, of infinitely near action, as
a general principle, and could not, for this reason, become reconciled to Newton’s Law of Gravitation, which entails action at
a distance and which corresponds fully to that of Coulomb The

the theories of physics we notice repeatedly that once we have
succeeded in bringing to light the uniformity of a certain group of
phenomena it may be expressed in formulæ of perfect mathematical harmony. After all, from the physical point of view, Maxwell’s
theory in its later form bears uninterrupted testimony to the stupendous fruitfulness which has resulted through passing from the
old idea of action at a distance to the modern one of infinitely
near action.
The field exerts on the charges which produce it a force of
which the density per unit volume is given by the formula

**p = ρE.** (52)

This is the rigorous interpretation of the equation (48).
If we bring a test charge (on a small body) into the field, it also
becomes one of the field-producing charges, and formula (48) will
lead to a correct determination of the field E existing before the
test charge was introduced, only if the test charge e is so weak that
its effect on the field is imperceptible. This is a difficulty which
permeates the whole of experimental physics, viz. that by introducing a measuring instrument the original conditions which are
to be measured become disturbed. This is, to a large extent, the
source of the errors to the elimination of which the experimenter
has to apply so much ingenuity.
The fundamental law of mechanics: mass × acceleration =
force, tells us how masses move under the influence of given forces
(the initial velocities being given). Mechanics does not, however,
teach us what is force; this we learn from physics. The fundamen_tal law of mechanics is a blank form which acquires a concrete_

consequence, always sought help by resorting to an explanation in
_words of the fundamental law: force signifies mass×acceleration._
In the present case of electrostatics, i.e. for the particular category
of physical phenomena, we recognise what is force, and how it is
determined according to a definite law by (52) from the phasequantities charge and field. If we regard the charges as being
given, the field equations (51) give the relation in virtue of which
the charges determine the field which they produce. With regard
to the charges, it is known that they are bound to matter. The
modern theory of electrons has shown that this can be taken in
a perfectly rigorous sense. Matter, is composed of elementary
quanta, electrons, which have a definite invariable mass, and, in
addition, a definite invariable charge. Whenever new charges appear to spring into existence, we merely observe the separation of
positive and negative elementary charges which were previously
so close together that the “action at a distance” of the one was
fully compensated by that of the other. In such processes, accordingly, just as much positive electricity “arises” as negative.
The laws thus constitute a cycle. The distribution of the elementary quanta of matter provided with charges fixed once and for
all (and, in the case of non-stationary conditions, also their velocities) determine the field. The field exerts upon charged matter a
ponderomotive force which is given by (52). The force determines,
in accordance with the fundamental law of mechanics, the acceleration, and hence the distribution and velocity of the matter at the
following moment. We require this whole network of theo**retical considerations to arrive at an experimental means**

ally.) We cannot merely test a single law detached from this theoretical fabric! The connection between direct experience and the
objective element behind it, which reason seeks to grasp conceptually in a theory, is not so simple that every single statement of the
theory has a meaning which may be verified by direct intuition.
We shall see more and more clearly in the sequel that Geometry,
Mechanics, and Physics form an inseparable theoretical whole in
this way. We must never lose sight of this totality when we enquire whether these sciences interpret rationally the reality which
proclaims itself in all subjective experiences of consciousness, and
which itself transcends consciousness: that is, truth forms a sys**tem. For the rest, the physical world-picture here described in its**
first outlines is characterised by the dualism of matter and field,
between which there is a reciprocal action. Not till the advent of
the theory of relativity was this dualism overcome, and, indeed,
in favour of a physics based solely on fields (cf. § 24).
The ponderomotive force in the electric field was traced back
to stresses even by Faraday. If we use a rectangular system of coordinates x1, x2, x3 in which E1, E2, E3 are the components of the
electrical intensity of field, the xi component of the force-density
is

� _∂E1_ �
_pi = ρEi = E_ + _[∂E][2]_ + _[∂E][3]_ _._

_∂x1_ _∂x2_ _∂x3_

By a simple calculation which takes account of the irrotational
property of E we discover from this that the components pi of
the force-density are derived by the formulæ (47) from the stress
tensor, the components Sik of which are tabulated in the following

_−E3E1_ _−E3E2_ 12 [(][E]1[2] [+][ E]2[2] _[−]_ _[E]3[2][)]������_


We observe that the condition of symmetry Ski = Sik is fulfilled.
It is, above all, important to notice that the components of the
stress tensor at a point depend only on the electrical intensity of
field at this point. (They, moreover, depend only on the field, and
not on the charge.) Whenever a force p can be retraced by (47) to
stresses S, which form a symmetrical tensor of the second order
only dependent on the values of the phase-quantities describing
the physical state at the point in question, we shall have to regard
these stresses as the primary factors and the actions of the forces
as their consequent. The mathematical justification for this point
of view is brought to light by the fact that the force p results from
differentiating the stress. Compared with forces, stresses are thus,
so to speak, situated on the next lower plane of differentiation, and
yet do not depend on the whole series of values traversed by the
phase-quantities, as would be the case for an arbitrary integral,
but only on its value at the point under consideration. It further
follows from the fact that the electrostatic forces which charged
bodies exert on one another can be retraced to a symmetrical
stress tensor, that the resulting total force as well as the resulting
couple vanishes (because the integral taken over the whole space
has a divergence = 0). This means that an isolated system of
charged masses which is initially at rest cannot of itself acquire a
translational or rotational motion as a whole.
The tensor (53) is of course independent of the choice of co

then we have

These are the co-variant stress components not only in a Cartesian
but also in any arbitrary affine co-ordinate system, if Ei are the covariant components of the field intensity. The physical significance
of these stresses is extremely simple. If, for a certain point, we
use rectangular co-ordinates, the x1 axis of which points in the
direction E: then

_E1 = |E|,_ _E2 = 0,_ _E3 = 0;_

we thus find them to be composed of a tension having the intensity

and the pressure which are exerted along and perpendicularly to

it is only the total energy which comes into consideration. Only
later, when we pass on to consider variable fields, shall we arrive
at irrefutable confirmation of the correctness of this view.
In the case of conductors in a statical field the charges collect
on the outer surface and there is no field in the interior. The
equations (51) then suffice to determine the electrical field in free
space in the “æther”. If, however, there are non-conductors, dielectrics in the field, the phenomenon of dielectric polarisation
(displacement) must be taken into consideration. Two charges +e
and −e at the points P1 and P2 respectively, “source and sink” as
we shall call them, produce a field, which arises from the potential

the moment m remains constant, we get, in the limit, a “doublet”
of moment m, the potential of which is given by

The result of an electric field in a dielectric is to give rise to
these doublets in the separate elements of volume: this effect is
known as polarisation. If m is the electric moment of the doublets per unit volume, then, instead of (50), the following formula
holds for the potential

� _ρ_ � 1
_−4πφ =_ _r [dV][ +]_ **m · gradP** _r [dv.]_ (56)

From the point of view of the theory of electrons this circumstance
becomes immediately intelligible. Let us, for example, imagine an
atom to consist of a positively charged “nucleus” at rest, around
which an oppositely charged electron rotates in a circular path.
The mean position of the electron for the mean time of a complete revolution of the electron round the nucleus will then coincide with the position of the nucleus, and the atom will appear
perfectly neutral from without. But if an electric field acts, it
exerts a force on the negative electron, as a result of which its
path will lie excentrically with respect to the atomic nucleus, e.g.
will become an ellipse with the nucleus at one of its foci. In the
mean, for times which are great compared with the time of revolution of the electron, the atom will act like a doublet; or if we
treat matter as being continuous we shall have to assume continuously distributed doublets in it Even before entering upon an

we may replace equation (56) by

If we now introduce the “electric displacement”

the fundamental equations become:

They correspond to equations (51); in one of them the intensity E

ence of the intervening medium which was experimentally proved
by Faraday, and which expresses itself in them, has been of great
importance in the development of the theory of action by contact.
We may here pass over the corresponding extension of the formulæ
for stress, energy, and force.
It is clear from the mode of derivation that (57) and (58) are
not rigorously valid laws, since they relate only to mean values
and are deduced for spaces containing a great number of atoms
and for times which are great compared with the times of revolution of the electrons round the atom. We still look upon (51)
**as expressing the physical laws exactly. Our objective here**
and in the sequel is above all to derive the strict physical laws.
But if we start from phenomena, such “phenomenological laws” as
(57) and (58) are necessary stages in passing from the results of
direct observation to the exact theory. In general, it is possible to
work out such a theory only by starting in this way. The validity
of the theory is then established if, with the aid of definite ideas
about the atomic structure of matter, we can again arrive at the
phenomenological laws by using mean value arguments. If the
atomic structure is known, this process must, in addition, yield
the values of the constants occurring in these laws and characteristic of the matter in question (such constants do not occur in
exact physical laws). Since laws of matter such as (58), which only
take the influence of massed matter into account, certainly fail for
events in which the fine structure of matter cannot be neglected,
the range of validity of the phenomenological theory must be furnished by an atomistic theory of this kind, as must also those laws
which have to be substituted in its place for the region beyond this

a complete statement of the more detailed structure of the atom
and its inner mechanism.
In the first experiments with permanent magnets, magnetism
appears to be a mere repetition of electricity: here Coulomb’s Law
holds likewise! A characteristic difference, however, immediately
asserts itself in the fact that positive and negative magnetism cannot be dissociated from one another. There are no sources, but
only doublets in the magnetic field. Magnets consist of infinitely
small elementary magnets, each of which itself contains positive
and negative magnetism. The amount of magnetism in every portion of matter is de facto nil; this would appear to mean that there
is really no such thing as magnetism. The explanation of this was
furnished by Oersted’s discovery of the magnetic action of electric
currents. The exact quantitative formulation of this action as expressed by Biot and Savart’s Law leads, just like Coulomb’s Law,
to two simple laws of action by contact. If s denotes the density
of the electric current, and H the intensity of the magnetic field,
then
curl H = s, div H = 0. (59)

The second equation asserts the non-existence of sources in the
magnetic field. Equations (59) are exactly analogous to (51) if div
and curl be interchanged. These two operations of vector analysis
correspond to one another in exactly the same way as do scalar and
vectorial multiplication in vector algebra (div denotes scalar, curl
vectorial, multiplication by the symbolic vector “differentiation”).
The solution of the equations (59) vanishes for infinite distances;
for a given distribution of current it is given by

“vector potential” −f in accordance with the formulæ

_r [dV.]_

Finally the formula for the density of force in the magnetic field
is
**p = [s, H]** (61)

corresponding exactly with (52).
There is no doubt that these laws give us a true statement of
magnetism. They are not a repetition but an exact counterpart
of electrical laws, and bear the same relation to the latter as vectorial products to scalar products. From them it may be proved
mathematically that a small circular current acts exactly like a
small elementary magnet thrust through it perpendicularly to its
plane. Following Ampère we have thus to imagine the magnetic
action of magnetised bodies to depend on molecular currents;
according to the electron theory these are straightway given by
the electrons circulating in the atom.
The force p in the magnetic field may also be traced back
to stresses, and we find, indeed, that we get the same values for
the stress components as in the electrostatic field: we need only
replace E by H. Consequently we shall use the corresponding
value [1]

the theory of fields varying with the time.

cross-section of each tube. In no wise does it follow from the laws
holding in a stationary field, nor does it come into consideration
for such a field, that this current is an electric current in the ordinary sense, i.e. that it is composed of electricity in motion; this
is, however, without doubt the case. In view of this fact the law
div s = 0 asserts that electricity is neither created nor destroyed.
It is only because the flux of the current vector through a closed
surface is nil that the density of electricity remains everywhere
unchanged—so that electricity is neither created nor destroyed.
(We are, of course, dealing with stationary fields exclusively.) The
expression vector potential f, introduced above, also satisfies
the equation div f = 0.
Being an electric current, s is without doubt a vector in the
true sense of the word. It then follows, however, from the Law of
Biot and Savart that H is not a vector but a linear tensor of
**the second order. Let its components in any co-ordinate system**
(Cartesian or even merely affine) be Hik. The vector potential f
is a true vector. If φi are its co-variant components and s[i] the
contra-variant components of the current-density (the current is
like velocity fundamentally a contra-variant vector), the following
table gives us the final form (independent of the dimensional number) of the laws which hold in the magnetic field produced

These are the laws that hold for the field in empty space.
We regard them as being exact physical laws which are generally
valid, as in the case of electricity. For a phenomenological theory it
is, however, necessary to take into consideration the magnetisa**tion, a phenomenon analogous to dielectric polarisation. Just as**
**D occurred in conjunction with E, so the “magnetic induction” B**
associates itself with the intensity of field H. The laws

hold in the field, as does the law which takes account of the magnetic character of the matter

single atom only becomes polarised by the action of the intensity
of the electrical field (i.e. becomes a doublet), (this takes place in
the direction of the field intensity), the atom is from the outset an
elementary magnet owing to the presence of rotating electrons in
it (at least, in the case of para- and ferro-magnetic substances).
All these elementary magnets, however, neutralise one another’s
effects, as long as they are irregularly arranged and all positions
of the electronic orbits occur equally frequently on the average.
The imposed magnetic force merely fulfils the function of direct**ing the existing doublets. It evidently is due to this fact that the**
range within which (63) holds is much less than the corresponding range of (63). Permanent magnets and ferro-magnetic bodies
(iron, cobalt, nickel) are, above all, not subject to it.
In the phenomenological theory there must be added to the
laws already mentioned that of Ohm:

**s = σE** (σ = conductivity).

It asserts that the current follows the fall of potential and is proportional to it for a given conductor. Corresponding to Ohm’s
Law we have in the atomic theory the fundamental law of mechanics, according to which the motion of the “free” electrons is
determined by the electric and magnetic forces acting on them
which thus produce an electric current. Owing to collisions with
the molecules no permanent acceleration can come about, but
(just as in the case of a heavy body which is falling and experiences the resistance of the air) a mean limiting velocity is reached,
which may, to a first approximation at least, be put proportional
to the driving electric force E In this way Ohm’s Law acquires a

the chemical action which takes place maintains a constant difference of potential, the “electromotive force,” between the two ends
of the conducting wire. Since the events which occur in the contrivance producing the current can obviously be understood only
in the light of an atomic theory, it leads to the simplest result phenomenologically to represent it by means of a cross-section taken
through the conducting circuit at each end, beyond which the
potential makes a sudden jump equal to the electromotive force.
This brief survey of Maxwell’s theory of stationary fields will
suffice for what follows. We have not the space here to enlarge
upon details and concrete applications.

THE METRICAL CONTINUUM

**§ 10. Note on Non-Euclidean Geometry[∗]**

Doubts as to the validity of Euclidean geometry seem to have
been raised even at the time of its origin, and are not, as our
philosophers usually assume, outgrowths of the hypercritical tendency of modern mathematicians. These doubts have from the
outset hovered round the fifth postulate. The substance of the
latter is that in a plane containing a given straight line g and a
point P external to the latter (but in the plane) there is only one
straight line through P which does not intersect g: it is called the
straight line parallel to P . Whereas the remaining axioms of Euclid are accepted as being self-evident, even the earliest exponents
of Euclid have endeavoured to prove this theorem from the remaining axioms. Nowadays, knowing that this object is unattainable,
we must look upon these reflections and efforts as the beginning
of “non-Euclidean” geometry, i.e. of the construction of a geometrical system which can be developed logically by accepting all the
axioms of Euclid, except the postulate of parallels. A report of
Proclus (a.d. 5) about these attempts has been handed down to
posterity. Proclus utters an emphatic warning against the abuse
that may be practised by calling propositions self-evident. This
warning cannot be repeated too often; on the other hand, we must
not fail to emphasise the fact that, in spite of the frequency with
which this property is wrongfully used, the “self-evident” property
is the final root of all knowledge, including empirical knowledge.
Proclus insists that “asymptotic lines” may exist.

be given in a plane, also a point P outside it in the plane, and
a straight line s passing through P and which may be rotated
about P . Let s be perpendicular to g initially. If we now ro

tate s, the point of intersection of s and g glides along g, e.g. to
the right, and if we continue turning, a definite moment arrives
at which this point of intersection just vanishes to infinity; s then
occupies the position of an “asymptotic” straight line. If we continue turning, Euclid assumes that, at even this same moment,
a point of intersection already appears on the left. Proclus, on
the other hand, points out the possibility that one may perhaps
have to turn s through a further definite angle before a point of
intersection arises to the left. We should then have two “asymptotic” straight lines, one to the right, viz. s[′], and the other to the
left, viz. s[′′]. If the straight line s through P were then situated
in the angular space between s[′′] and s[′] (during the rotation just
described) it would cut g; if it lay between s[′] and s[′′], it would not
intersect g. There must be at least one non-intersecting straight
line; this follows from the other axioms of Euclid. I shall recall a
familiar figure of our early studies in plane geometry, consisting
of the straight line h and two straight lines g and g[′] which intersect h at A and A[′] and make equal angles with it g and g[′] are

there would also be a point of intersection S[∗] to the left of h. But
this is impossible since there is only one straight line that passes
through two given points S and S[∗].
Attempts to prove Euclid’s postulate were continued by Arabian and western mathematicians of the Middle Ages. Passing
straight to a more recent period we shall mention the names of
only the last eminent forerunners of non-Euclidean geometry, viz.
the Jesuit father Saccheri (beginning of the eighteenth century)
and the mathematicians Lambert and Legendre. Saccheri was
aware that the question whether the postulate of parallels is valid
is equivalent to the question whether the sum of the angles of a
triangle are equal to or less than 180[◦]. If they amount to 180[◦]

in one triangle, then they must do so in every triangle and Euclidean geometry holds. If the sum is < 180[◦] in one triangle then
it is < 180[◦] in every triangle. That they cannot be > 180[◦] is
excluded for the same reason for which we just now concluded


-----

_g_
angles to be < 180[◦] there must be a unique length in geometry.
This is closely related to an observation which Wallis had previously made that there can be no similar figures of different sizes in
non-Euclidean geometry (just as in the case of the geometry of the
surface of a rigid sphere). Hence if there is such a thing as “form”
independent of size, Euclidean geometry is justified in its claims.
Lambert, moreover, deduced a formula for the area of a triangle,
from which it is clear that, in the case of non-Euclidean geometry,
this area cannot increase beyond all limits. It appears that the
researches of these men has gradually spread the belief in wide
circles that the postulate of parallels cannot be proved. At that
time this problem occupied many minds. D’Alembert pronounced
it a scandal of geometry that it had not yet been decisively settled.
Even the authority of Kant, whose philosophic system claims Euclidean geometry as a priori knowledge representing the content
of pure space-intuition in adequate judgments, did not succeed in
settling these doubts permanently.
Gauss also set out originally to prove the axiom of parallels,
but he early gained the conviction that this was impossible and
thereupon developed the principles of a non-Euclidean geometry,
for which the axioms of parallels does not hold, to such an extent that, from it, the further development could be carried out
with the same ease as for Euclidean geometry. He did not make
his investigations known for, as he later wrote in a private letter,
he feared “the outcry of the Bœotians”; for, he said, there were
only a few people who understood what was the true essence of
these questions. Independently of Gauss, Schweikart, a professor
of jurisprudence, gained a full insight into the conditions of non

,
established that Euclidean geometry is valid in our actual space.
His nephew Taurinus whom he encouraged to study these questions was, in contrast to him, a believer of Euclidean geometry,
but we are nevertheless indebted to Taurinus for the discovery of
the fact that the formulæ of spherical trigonometry are real on a
sphere which has an imaginary radius = _[√]−1, and that through_
them a geometrical system is constructed along analytical lines
which satisfies all the axioms of Euclid except the fifth postulate.
For the general public the honour of discovering and elaborating non-Euclidean geometry must be shared between Nikolaj
Iwanowitsch Lobatschefskij (1793–1856), a Russian professor of
mathematics at Kasan, and Johann Bolyai (1802–1860), a Hungarian officer in the Austrian army. The ideas of both assumed a
tangible form in 1826. The chief manuscript of both, by which the
public were informed of their discovery and which offered an argument of the new geometry in the manner of Euclid, had its origin
in 1830–1831. The discussion by Bolyai is particularly clear, inasmuch as he carries the argument as far as possible without making
an assumption as to the validity or non-validity of the fifth postulate, and only afterwards derives the theorems of Euclidean and
non-Euclidean geometry from the theorems of his “absolute” geometry according to whether one decides in favour of or against
Euclid.
Although the structure was thus erected, it was by no means
definitely decided whether, in absolute geometry, the axiom of
parallels would not after all be shown to be a dependent theorem.
The strict proof that non-Euclidean geometry is absolutely
**consistent in itself had yet to follow. This resulted almost of**

at once. It was discovered by Klein as late as 1870 and depends
on the construction of a Euclidean model for non-Euclidean
geometry (vide note 2). Let us confine our attention to the plane!
In a Euclidean plane with rectangular co-ordinates x and y we
shall draw a circle U of radius unity with the origin as centre.
Introducing homogeneous co-ordinates

_x =_ _[x][1]_ _,_ _y =_ _[x][2]_

_x3_ _x3_


(so that the position of a point is defined by the ratio of three
numbers, i.e. x1 : x2 : x3), the equation to the circle becomes

_−x[2]1_ _[−]_ _[x]2[2]_ [+][ x]3[2] [= 0][.]

Let us denote the quadratic form on the left by Ω(x) and the
corresponding symmetrical bilinear form of two systems of value,
_xi, x[′]i_ [by][ Ω(][x, x][′][)][. A transformation which assigns to every point][ x]

is called, as we know, a collineation (affine transformations are a
special class of collineations). It transforms every straight line,
point for point, into another straight line and leaves the crossratio of four points on a straight line unaltered. We shall now
set up a little dictionary by which we translate the conceptions of
Euclidean geometry into a new language, that of non-Euclidean
geometry; we use inverted commas to distinguish its words The

(Fig. 4).
A “straight line” signifies the portion of a straight line lying
wholly in U . The collineations which transform the circle U into
itself are of two kinds; the first leaves the sense in which U is

described unaltered, whereas the second reverses it. The former
are called “congruent” transformations; two figures composed of
points are called “congruent” if they can be transformed into one
another by such a transformation. All the axioms of Euclid except
the postulate of parallels hold for these “points,” “straight lines,”
and the conception “congruence”. A whole sheaf of “straight lines”
passing through the “point” P which do not cut the one “straight
line” g is shown in Fig. 4. This suffices to prove the consistency
of non-Euclidean geometry, for things and relations are shown for

out further explanation, that Klein’s model is also applicable to
spatial geometry.
We now determine the non-Euclidean distance between two
“points” in this model, viz. between

_A = (x1 : x2 : x3) and A[′]_ = (x[′]1 [:][ x]2[′] [:][ x]3[′] [)][.]

Let the straight line AA[′] cut the circle U in the two points, B1, B2.
The homogeneous co-ordinates yi of these two points are of the
form
_yi = λxi + λ[′]x[′]i_

and the corresponding ratio of the parameters, λ : λ[′], is given by
the equation Ω(y) = 0, viz.

_λ_ �Ω[2](x, x[′]) − Ω(x)Ω(x[′])

_._

_λ[′][ =][ −][Ω(][x, x][′][)][ ±]_ Ω(x)


Hence the cross-ratio of the four points, A, A[′], B1, B2 is

�Ω[2](x, x[′]) − Ω(x)Ω(x[′])

[AA[′]] = [Ω(][x, x][′][) +] _._

Ω(x, x[′]) − �Ω[2](x, x[′]) − Ω(x)Ω(x[′])


This quantity which depends on the two arbitrary “points,” A, A[′],
is not altered by a “congruent” transformation. If A, A[′], A[′′] are
any three “points” lying on a “straight line” in the order written,
then

[AA[′′]] = [AA[′]] · [A[′]A[′′]].

The quantity


-----

p p y

_AA[′]_ + A[′]A[′′] = AA[′′].

As it has the same value for “congruent” distances AA[′] too, we
must regard it as the non-Euclidean distance between the two
points, A, A[′]. Assuming the logs to be taken to the base e, we
get an absolute determination for the unit of measure, as was
recognised by Lambert. The definition may be written in the
shorter form:

Ω(x, x[′])
cosh r = (1)
�Ω(x) · Ω(x[′])

(cosh denotes the hyperbolic cosine).

This measure-determination had already been enunciated before
Klein by Cayley[∗] who referred it to an arbitrary real or imaginary conic section Ω(x) = 0: he called it the “projective measuredetermination”. But it was reserved for Klein to recognise that in
the case of a real conic it leads to non-Euclidean geometry.
It must not be thought that Klein’s model shows that the nonEuclidean plane is finite. On the contrary, using non-Euclidean
measures I can mark off the same distance on a “straight line” an
infinite number of times in succession. It is only by using Eu**clidean measures in the Euclidean model that the distances of**
these “equidistant” points becomes smaller and smaller. For nonEuclidean geometry the bounding circle U represents unattainable, infinitely distant, regions.
If we use an imaginary conic, Cayley’s measure-determination
leads to ordinary spherical geometry, such as holds on the surface


-----

p p p
straight lines in it, but every pair of points at the end of the same
diameter must be regarded as a single “point,” in order that two
“straight lines” may only intersect at one “point”. Let us project
the points on the sphere by means of (straight) rays from the
centre on to the tangential plane at a point on the surface of the
sphere, e.g. the south pole. Two diametrically opposite points will
then coincide on the tangential plane as a result of the transformation. We must, in addition, as in projective geometry, furnish
this plane with an infinitely distant straight line; this is given by
the projection of the equator. We shall now call two figures in this
plane “congruent” if their projections (through the centre) on to
the surface of the sphere are congruent in the ordinary Euclidean
sense. Provided this conception of “congruence” is used, a nonEuclidean geometry, in which all the axioms of Euclid except the
fifth postulate are fulfilled, holds in this plane. Instead of this
postulate we have the fact that each pair of straight lines, without exception, intersects, and, in accordance with this, the sum
of the angles in a triangle > 180[◦]. This seems to conflict with
the Euclidean proof quoted above. The apparent contradiction
is explained by the circumstance that in the present “spherical”
geometry the straight line is closed, whereas Euclid, although he
does not explicitly state it in his axioms, tacitly assumes that it is
an open line, i.e. that each of its points divides it into two parts.
The deduction that the hypothetical point of intersection S on
the “right-hand” side is different from that S[∗] on the “left-hand”
side is rigorously true only if this “openness” be assumed.
Let us mark out in space a Cartesian co-ordinate system
_x1, x2, x3, having its origin at the centre of the sphere and the_


-----

p g g 1[,] 2[,] 3
co-ordinates of any point on the sphere, i.e.

Ω(x) ≡ _x[2]1_ [+][ x]2[2] [+][ x]3[2] [= 1]

then _[x][1]_ and _[x][2]_ are respectively the first and second co-ordinate

_x3_ _x3_

of the transformed point in our plane x3 = 1, i.e. x1 : x2 : x3 is the
ratio of the homogeneous co-ordinates of the transformed point.
Congruent transformations of the sphere are linear transformations which leave the quadratic form Ω(x) invariant. The “congruent” transformations of the plane in terms of our “spherical”
geometry are thus given by such linear transformations of the homogeneous co-ordinates as convert the equation Ω(x) = 0, which
signifies an imaginary conic, into itself. This proves the statement
made above concerning the relationship between spherical geometry and Cayley’s measure-relation. This agreement is expressed
in the formula for the distance r between two points A, A[′], which
is here

Ω(x, x[′])
cos r = _._ (2)
�Ω(x)Ω(x[′])

At the same time we have confirmed the discovery of Taurinus that
Euclidean geometry is identical with non-Euclidean geometry on
a sphere of radius _[√]−1._
Euclidean geometry occupies an intermediate position between
that of Bolyai-Lobatschefsky and spherical geometry. For if we
make a real conic section change to a degenerate one, and thence
to an imaginary one, we find that the plane with its corresponding
Cayley measure-relation is at first Bolyai-Lobatschefskyan, then

The next stage in the development of non-Euclidean geometry
that concerns us chiefly is that due to Riemann. It links up with
the foundations of Differential Geometry, in particular with that
of the theory of surfaces as set out by Gauss in his Disquisitiones
_circa superficies curvas._
**The most fundamental property of space is that its**
**points form a three-dimensional manifold. What does this**
convey to us? We say, for example, that ellipses form a twodimensional manifold (as regards their size and form, i.e. considering congruent ellipses similar, non-congruent ellipses as dissimilar), because each separate ellipse may be distinguished in the
manifold by two given numbers, the lengths of the semi-major
and semi-minor axis. The difference in the conditions of equilibrium of an ideal gas which is given by two independent variables,
such as pressure and temperature, form a two-dimensional manifold, likewise the points on a sphere, or the system of pure tones
(in terms of intensity and pitch). According to the physiological
theory which states that the sensation of colour is determined by
the combination of three chemical processes taking place on the
retina (the black-white, red-green, and the yellow-blue process,
each of which can take place in a definite direction with a definite intensity), colours form a three-dimensional manifold with
respect to quality and intensity, but colour qualities form only a
two-dimensional manifold. This is confirmed by Maxwell’s familiar construction of the colour triangle. The possible positions of a
rigid body form a six-dimensional manifold, the possible positions
of a mechanical system having n degrees of freedom constitute, in
l di i l if ld **Th** **h** **i** **i** **f**


-----

**posing it (in our examples, single points, conditions of a gas,**
colours, tones) may be specified by the giving of n quan**tities, the “co-ordinates,” which are continuous functions**
**within the manifold. This does not mean that the whole man-**
ifold with all its elements must be represented in a single and
reversible manner by value systems of n co-ordinates (e.g. this is
impossible in the case of the sphere, for which n = 2); it signifies only that if P is an arbitrary element of the manifold, then
in every case a certain domain surrounding the point P must be
representable singly and reversibly by the value system of n coordinates. If xi is a system of n co-ordinates, x[′]i [another system]
of n co-ordinates, then the co-ordinate values xi, x[′]i [of the same]
element will in general be connected with one another by relations

_xi = fi(x[′]1[, x][′]2[, . . ., x]n[′]_ [)] (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) (3)

which can be resolved into terms of x[′]i [and in which the][ f][i][’s are]
continuous functions of their arguments. As long as nothing more
is known about the manifold, we cannot distinguish any one coordinate system from the others. For an analytical treatment of
arbitrary continuous manifolds we thus require a theory of invariance with regard to arbitrary transformation of co-ordinates,
such as (3), whereas for the development of affine geometry in the
preceding chapter we used only the much more special theory of
invariance for the case of linear transformations.
Differential geometry deals with curves and surfaces in threedimensional Euclidean space; we shall here consider them mapped
out in Cartesian co-ordinates x, y, z. A curve is in general a
one dimensional point manifold; its separate points can be distin


-----

p pp p, y, p,
then x, y, z will be certain continuous functions of u:

_x = x(u),_ _y = y(u),_ _z = z(u)_ (4)

and (4) is called the “parametric” representation of the curve. If
we interpret u as the time, then (4) is the law of motion of a
point which traverses the given curve. The curve itself does not,
however, determine singly the parametric representation (4) of the
curve; the parameter u may, indeed, be subjected to any arbitrary
continuous transformation.
A two-dimensional point-manifold is called a surface. Its
points can be distinguished from one another by the values of two
parameters u1, u2. It may therefore be represented parametrically
in the form

_x = x(u1, u2),_ _y = y(u1, u2),_ _z = z(u1, u2)._ (5)

The parameters u1, u2 may likewise undergo any arbitrary continuous transformation without affecting the represented curve. We
shall assume that the functions (5) are not only continuous but
have also continuous differential co-efficients. Gauss, in his general
theory, starts from the form (5) of representing any surface; the
parameters u1, u2 are hence called the Gaussian (or curvilinear)
co-ordinates on the surface. For example, if, as in the preceding
section, we project the points of the surface of the unit sphere in a
small region encircling the origin of the co-ordinate system on to
the tangent plane z = 1 at the south pole, and if we make x, y, z
the co-ordinates of any arbitrary point on the sphere, u1 and u2
being respectively the x and y co ordinates of the point of projec

This is a parametric representation of the sphere. It does not, however, embrace the whole sphere, but only a certain region round
the south pole, viz. the part from the south pole to the equator,
excluding the latter. Another illustration of a parametric representation is given by the geographical co-ordinates, latitude and
longitude.
In thermodynamics we use a graphical representation consisting of a plane on which two rectangular co-ordinate axes are
drawn, and in which the state of a gas as denoted by its pressure p
and temperature θ is represented by a point having the rectangular co-ordinates p, θ. The same procedure may be adopted here.
With the point u1, u2 on the surface, we associate a point in the
“representative” plane having the rectangular co-ordinates u1, u2.
The formulæ (5) do not then represent only the surface, but also
at the same time a definite continuous representation of this
surface on the u1, u2 plane. Geographical maps are familiar instances of such representations of curved portions of surface by
means of planes. A curve on a surface is given mathematically by
a parametric representation

_u1 = u1(t),_ _u2 = u2(t),_ (7)

whereas a portion of a surface is given by a “mathematical region” expressed in the variables u1, u2, and which must be characterised by inequalities involving u1 and u2; i e graphically by

network of co-ordinates in the manner of squared paper, then this
becomes transposed, through the representation, to the curved
surface as a net consisting of meshes having the form of little
parallelograms, and composed of the two families of “co-ordinate
lines” u1 = const., u2 = const., respectively. If the meshes be
made sufficiently fine it becomes possible to map out any given
figure of the representative plane on the curved surface.
The distance ds between two infinitely near points of the surface, namely,

(u1, u2) and (u1 + du1, u2 + du2)

is determined by the expression

_ds[2]_ = dx[2] + dy[2] + dz[2]

Gauss was the first to recognise that the metrical groundform is
the determining factor for geometry on surfaces. The lengths of
curves, angles, and the size of given regions on the surface depend
on it alone. The geometries on two different surfaces is accordingly
identical if, for a representation in appropriate parameters, the coefficients gik of the metrical groundform coincide in value.

for its immediate neighbourhood, then equation (8), in which the
derivatives are to be taken for the point P [0], will hold more exactly

small” values du1 and du2. If we add to these the analogous equations for dy and dz, then they express that the immediate neighbourhood of P [0] is a plane, and that du1, du2 are affine co-ordinates

equal to 0, if, and only if, the surface degenerates to a curve, i.e. the functions

This proves Gauss’ statement. The values of the expressions obtained are of course independent of the choice of parametric representation. This invariance with respect to arbitrary transformations of the parameters can easily be confirmed analytically.
All the geometric relations holding on the surface can be studied
on the representative plane. The geometry of this plane is the
same as that of the curved surface if we agree to accept the distance ds of two infinitely near points as expressed by (9) and not
by Pythagoras’ formula

_ds[2]_ = du[2]1 [+][ du]2[2][.]

The geometry of the surface deals with the inner measure relations of the surface that belong to it independently of the manner
in which it is embedded in space. They are the relations that can
be determined by measurements carried out on the surface
**itself. Gauss in his investigation of the theory of surfaces started**
from the practical task of surveying Hanover geodetically. The
fact that the earth is not a plane can be ascertained by measuring
a sufficiently large portion of the earth’s surface. Even if each
single triangle of the network is taken too small for the deviation
from a plane to come into consideration, they cannot be put together to form a closed net on a plane in the way they do on the
earth’s surface. To show this a little more clearly let us draw a
circle C on a sphere of radius unity (the earth), having its centre P on the surface of the sphere. Let us further draw radii of
this circle, i.e. arcs of great circles of the sphere radiating from P
and ending at the circumference of C (let these arcs be < [π]

shortest lines connecting P to the circle C, and that they are all
of the same length r; by measurement we find the closed curve C
to be of length s. If we were dealing with a plane we should infer
from this that the “radii” are straight lines and hence the curve C
would be a circle and we should expect s to be equal to 2πr. Instead of this, however, we find that s is less than the value given
by the above formula, for in the actual case s = 2π sin r. We thus
discover by measurements carried out on the surface of the sphere
that this surface is not a plane. If, on the other hand, we draw
figures on a sheet of paper and then roll it up, we shall find the
same values for measurements of these figures in their new condition as before, provided that no distortion has occurred through
rolling up the paper. The same geometry will hold on it now as on
the plane. It is impossible for me to ascertain that it is curved by
carrying out geodetic measurements. Thus, in general, the same
geometry holds for two surfaces that can be transformed into one
another without distortion or tearing.
The fact that plane geometry does not hold on the sphere
means analytically that it is impossible to convert the quadratic
differential form (10) by means of a transformation

_u1 = u1(u[′]1[, u][′]2[)]_ _u[′]1_ [=][ u]1[′] [(][u][1][, u][2][)]

We know, indeed, that it is possible to do this for each point by a
linear transformation of the differentials, viz. by

Curvilinear co-ordinates are used not only in the theory of
surfaces but also in the treatment of space problems, particularly
in mathematical physics in which it is often necessary to adapt
the co-ordinate system to the bodies presented, as is instanced in
the case of cylindrical, spherical, and elliptic co-ordinates. The
square of the distance, ds[2], between two infinitely near points in
space, is always expressed by a quadratic form

in which x1, x2, x3 are any arbitrary co-ordinates. If we uphold
Euclidean geometry, we express the belief that this quadratic form
can be brought by means of some transformation into one which
has constant co-efficients.
These introductory remarks enable us to grasp the full meaning of the ideas developed fully by Riemann in his inaugural address, “Concerning the Hypotheses which lie at the Base of Geometry”.[∗] It is evident from Chapter I that Euclidean geometry holds for a three-dimensional linear point-configuration in a
four-dimensional Euclidean space; but curved three-dimensional
spaces, which exist in four-dimensional space just as much as
curved surfaces occur in three-dimensional space, are of a different type. Is it not possible that our three-dimensional space
of ordinary experience is curved? Certainly. It is not embedded
in a four-dimensional space; but it is conceivable that its inner

is conceivable that a very careful geodetic survey of our space carried out in the same way as the above-mentioned survey of the
earth’s surface might disclose that it is not plane. We shall continue to regard it as a three-dimensional manifold, and to suppose
that infinitesimal line elements may be compared with one another
in respect to length independently of their position and direction,
and that the square of their lengths, the distance between two
infinitely near points, may be expressed by a quadratic form (12),
any arbitrary co-ordinates xi being used. (There is a very good
reason for this assumption; for, since every transformation from
one co-ordinate system to another entails linear transformationformulæ for the co-ordinate differentials, a quadratic form must
always again pass into a quadratic form as a result of the transformation.) We no longer assume, however, that these co-ordinates
may in particular be chosen as affine co-ordinates such that they
make the co-efficients gik of the groundform become constant.
The transition from Euclidean geometry to that of Riemann
is founded in principle on the same idea as that which led from
physics based on action at a distance to physics based on infinitely
near action. We find by observation, for example, that the current
flowing along a conducting wire is proportional to the difference
of potential between the ends of the wire (Ohm’s Law). But we
are firmly convinced that this result of measurement applied to
a long wire does not represent a physical law in its most general
form; we accordingly deduce this law by reducing the measurements obtained to an infinitely small portion of wire. By this
means we arrive at the expression (Chap. I, page 111) on which
Maxwell’s theory is founded. Proceeding in the reverse direction,

**that conditions are everywhere similar (homogeneity). We**
have the same circumstances here. The fundamental fact of Euclidean geometry is that the square of the distance between two
points is a quadratic form of the relative co-ordinates of the two
points (Pythagoras’ Theorem). But if we look upon this law as
_being strictly valid only for the case when these two points are in-_
_finitely near, we enter the domain of Riemann’s geometry. This at_
the same time allows us to dispense with defining the co-ordinates
more exactly since Pythagoras’ Law expressed in this form (i.e. for
infinitesimal distances) is invariant for arbitrary transformations.
We pass from Euclidean “finite” geometry to Riemann’s “infinitesimal” geometry in a manner exactly analogous to that by which we
pass from “finite” physics to “infinitesimal” (or “contact”) physics.
Riemann’s geometry is Euclidean geometry formulated to meet
the requirements of continuity, and in virtue of this formulation it
assumes a much more general character. Euclidean finite geometry is the appropriate instrument for investigating the straight
line and the plane, and the treatment of these problems directed
its development. As soon as we pass over to differential geometry, it becomes natural and reasonable to start from the property
of infinitesimals set out by Riemann. This gives rise to no complications, and excludes all speculative considerations tending to
overstep the boundaries of geometry. In Riemann’s space, too,
a surface, being a two-dimensional manifold, may be represented
parametrically in the form xi = xi(u1, u2). If we substitute the
resulting differentials,

square of the distance between two infinitely near surface-points

The measure-relations of three-dimensional Riemann space may
be applied directly to any surface existing in it, and thus converts
it into a two-dimensional Riemann space. Whereas from the Euclidean standpoint space is assumed at the very outset to be of
a much simpler character than the surfaces possible in it, viz. to
be rectangular, Riemann has generalised the conception of space
just sufficiently far to overcome this discrepancy. The princi**ple of gaining knowledge of the external world from the**
**behaviour of its infinitesimal parts is the mainspring of the**
theory of knowledge in infinitesimal physics as in Riemann’s geometry, and, indeed, the mainspring of all the eminent work of
Riemann, in particular, that dealing with the theory of complex
functions. The question of the validity of the “fifth postulate,” on
which historical development started its attack on Euclid, seems
to us nowadays to be a somewhat accidental point of departure.
The knowledge that was necessary to take us beyond the Euclidean
view was, in our opinion, revealed by Riemann.
We have yet to convince ourselves that the geometry of Bolyai
and Lobatschefsky as well as that of Euclid and also spherical geometry (Riemann was the first to point out that the latter was a
possible case of non-Euclidean geometry) are all included as particular cases in Riemann’s geometry. We find, in fact, that if we
denote a point in the Bolyai-Lobatschefsky plane by the rectangular co-ordinates u1, u2 of its corresponding point in Klein’s model
the distance ds between two infinitely near points is by (1)

(1 2 2)(d 2 + d 2) + ( _d_ + _d_ )[2]

is again confirmed. The metrical groundform of three-dimensional
non-Euclidean space corresponds exactly to this expression.

If we can find a curved surface in Euclidean
space for which formula (13) holds, provided appropriate Gaussian co-ordinates u1, u2 be chosen,
then the geometry of Bolyai and Lobatschefsky is
valid on it. Such surfaces can actually be constructed; the simplest is the surface of revolution
derived from the tractrix. The tractrix is a plane
curve of the shape shown in Fig. 5, with one vertex
and one asymptote. It is characterised geometrically by the property that any tangent measured
from the point of contact to the point of intersection with the asymptote is of constant length.
Suppose the curve to revolve about its asymptote Fig. 5.
as axis. Non-Euclidean geometry holds on the
surface generated. This Euclidean model of striking simplicity
was first mentioned by Beltrami (vide note 5). There are certain
shortcomings in it; in the first place the form in which it is presented confines it to two-dimensional geometry; secondly, each of
the two halves of the surface of revolution into which the sharp
edge divides it represents only a part of the non-Euclidean plane.
Hilbert proved rigorously that there cannot be a surface free from
singularities in Euclidean space which pictures the whole of Lobatschefsky’s plane (vide note 6). Both of these weaknesses are
absent in the elementary geometrical model of Klein.
So far we have pursued a speculative train of thought and have
kept within the boundaries of mathematics. There is, however, a

**holds in actual space. To decide this question Gauss long ago**
measured the triangle having for its vertices Inselsberg, Brocken,
and Hoher Hagen (near Göttingen), using methods of the greatest
refinement, but the deviation of the sum of the angles from 180[◦]

was found to lie within the limits of errors of observation. Lobatschefsky concluded from the very small value of the parallaxes
of the stars that actual space could differ from Euclidean space
only by an extraordinarily small amount. Philosophers have put
forward the thesis that the validity or non-validity of Euclidean
geometry cannot be proved by empirical observations. It must
in fact be granted that in all such observations essentially physical assumptions, such as the statement that the path of a ray of
light is a straight line and other similar statements, play a prominent part. This merely bears out the remark already made above
that it is only the whole composed of geometry and physics that
may be tested empirically. Conclusive experiments are thus possible only if physics in addition to geometry is worked out for
Euclidean space and generalised Riemann space. We shall soon
see that without making artificial limitations we can easily translate the laws of the electromagnetic field, which were originally set
up on the basis of Euclidean geometry, into terms of Riemann’s
space. Once this has been done there is no reason why experience
should not decide whether the special view of Euclidean geometry
or the more general one of Riemann geometry is to be upheld. It
is clear that at the present stage this question is not yet ripe for
discussion.
In this concluding paragraph we shall once again present the
foundations of Riemann’s geometry in the form of a résumé, in

We shall now revert to the theory of surfaces in Euclidean
space. The curvature of a plane curve may be defined in the
following way as the measure of the rate at which the normals
to the curve diverge. From a fixed point O we trace out the
vector Op, the “normal” to the curve at an arbitrary point P, and
make it of unit length. This gives us a point P, corresponding
to P, on the circle of radius unity. If P traverses a small arc ∆s of
the curve, the corresponding point p will traverse an arc ∆σ of the
circle; ∆σ is the plane angle which is the sum of the angles that the
normals erected at all points of the arc of the curve make with their

respective neighbours. The limiting value of the quotient [∆][σ]

of the rate at which its normals diverge in an exactly analogous
manner. In place of the unit circle about O, he uses the unit
sphere. Applying the same method of representation he makes a
small portion dω of this sphere correspond to a small area do of
the surface; dω is equal to the solid angle formed by the normals

erected at the points of do. The ratio _[dω]_

_do_ [for the limiting case]
when do becomes vanishingly small is the Gaussian measure of
_curvature. Gauss made the important discovery that this curvature_
_is determined by the inner measure-relations of the surface alone,_
_and that it can be calculated from the co-efficients of the metrical_
_groundform as a differential expression of the second order. The_
curvature accordingly remains unaltered if the surface be bent
without being distorted by stretching. By this geometrical means
a differential invariant of the quadratic differential forms
of two variables was discovered, that is to say, a quantity was
found, formed of the co-efficients of the differential form in such
a way that its value was the same for two differential forms that
arise from each other by a transformation (and also for parametric
pairs which correspond to one another in the transformation).
Riemann succeeded in extending the conception of curvature
to quadratic forms of three and more variables. He then found that
it was no longer a scalar but a tensor (we shall discuss this in § 15
of the present chapter). More precisely it may be stated that Riemann’s space has a definite curvature at every point in the normal
direction of every surface. The characteristic of Euclidean space
is that its curvature is nil at every point and in every direction.

(It may therefore be put = ±1 if a suitable unit of length be chosen.) If an n-dimensional space has a constant curvature a, then
if we choose appropriate co-ordinates xi, its metrical groundform
must be of the form

It is thus completely defined in a single-valued manner. If space
is everywhere homogeneous in all directions, its curvature must
be constant, and consequently its metrical groundform must be
of the form just given. Such a space is necessarily either Euclidean, spherical, or Lobatschefskyan. Under these circumstances
not only have the line elements an existence which is independent
of place and direction, but any arbitrary finitely extended figure
may be transferred to any arbitrary place and put in any arbitrary
direction without altering its metrical conditions, i.e. its displacements are congruent. This brings us back to congruent transformations which we used as a starting-point for our reflections on
space in § 1. Of these three possible cases the Euclidean one is
characterised by the circumstance that the group of translations
having the special properties set out in § 1 are unique in the group
of congruent transformations. The facts which are summarised in
this paragraph are mentioned briefly in Riemann’s essay; they
have been discussed in greater detail by Christoffel, Lipschitz,
Helmholtz, and Sophus Lie (vide note 7).

ation from the outset, and that all the others must be rejected
without further examination as being of no account: parturiunt
_montes, nascetur ridiculus mus! Riemann held a different opin-_
ion, as is evidenced by the concluding remarks of his essay. Their
full purport was not grasped by his contemporaries, and his words
died away almost unheard (with the exception of a solitary echo
in the writings of W. K. Clifford). Only now that Einstein has
removed the scales from our eyes by the magic light of his theory
of gravitation do we see what these words actually mean. To make
them quite clear I must begin by remarking that Riemann contrasts discrete manifolds, i.e. those composed of single isolated
elements, with continuous manifolds. The measure of every part
of such a discrete manifold is determined by the number of elements belonging to it. Hence, as Riemann expresses it, a discrete
manifold has the principle of its metrical relations in itself, a pri_ori, as a consequence of the concept of number. In Riemann’s own_
words:—
“The question of the validity of the hypotheses of geometry in
the infinitely small is bound up with the question of the ground
of the metrical relations of space. In this question, which we may
still regard as belonging to the doctrine of space, is found the application of the remark made above; that in a discrete manifold,
the principle or character of its metric relations is already given in
the notion of the manifold, whereas in a continuous manifold this
ground has to be found elsewhere, i.e. has to come from outside.
Either, therefore, the reality which underlies space must form a
discrete manifold, or we must seek the ground of its metric relations (measure-conditions) outside it, in binding forces which act

starting from the conception of phenomena which has hitherto
been justified by experience, to which Newton laid the foundation, and then making in this conception the successive changes
required by facts which admit of no explanation on the old theory; researches of this kind, which commence with general notions,
cannot be other than useful in preventing the work from being
hampered by too narrow views, and in keeping progress in the
knowledge of the inter-connections of things from being checked
by traditional prejudices.
“This carries us over into the sphere of another science, that
of physics, into which the character and purpose of the present
discussion will not allow us to enter.”
If we discard the first possibility, “that the reality which underlies space forms a discrete manifold”—although we do not by this
in any way mean to deny finally, particularly nowadays in view of
the results of the quantum-theory, that the ultimate solution of the
problem of space may after all be found in just this possibility—
we see that Riemann rejects the opinion that had prevailed up
to his own time, namely, that the metrical structure of space is
fixed and inherently independent of the physical phenomena for
which it serves as a background, and that the real content takes
possession of it as of residential flats. He asserts, on the contrary,
_that space in itself is nothing more than a three-dimensional man-_
_ifold devoid of all form; it acquires a definite form only through_
_the advent of the material content filling it and determining its_
_metric relations. There remains the problem of ascertaining the_
laws in accordance with which this is brought about. In any case,
however, the metrical groundform will alter in the course of time

lations by making the body carry along with it the “metrical field”
which it has produced (and which is represented by the metrical
groundform); just as a mass, having assumed a definite shape in
equilibrium under the influence of the field of force which it has
itself produced, would become deformed if one could keep the field
of force fixed while displacing the mass to another position in it;
whereas, in reality, it retains its shape during motion (supposed to
be sufficiently slow), since it carries the field of force, which it has
produced, along with itself. We shall illustrate in greater detail
this bold idea of Riemann concerning the metrical field produced
by matter, and we shall show that if his opinion is correct, any two
portions of space which can be transformed into one another by
a continuous deformation, must be recognised as being congruent
in the sense we have adopted, and that the same material content
can fill one portion of space just as well as the other.
To simplify this examination of the underlying principles we
assume that the material content can be described fully by scalar
phase quantities such as mass-density, density of charge, and so
forth. We fix our attention on a definite moment of time. During this moment the density ρ of charge, for example, will, if we
choose a certain co-ordinate system in space, be a definite function f (x1, x2, x3) of the co-ordinates x1 but will be represented
by a different function f _[∗](x[∗]1[, x][∗]2[, x][∗]3[)][ if we use another co-ordinate]_
system in x[∗]i [.][ A parenthetical note.][ Beginners are often confused]
by failing to notice that in mathematical literature symbols are
used throughout to designate functions, whereas in physical literature (including the mathematical treatment of physics) they
are used exclusively to denote “magnitudes” (quantities). For

the other case v, is kept constant. The symbolism of the mathematician is clear without any such addition.[∗]

Although the true state of things is really more complex we
shall assume the most simple system of geometrical optics, the fundamental law of which states that the ray of light from a point M
emitting light to an observer at P is a “geodetic” line, which is the
shortest of all the lines connecting M with P : we take no account
of the finite velocity with which light is propagated. We ascribe
to the receiving consciousness merely an optical faculty of perception and simplify this to a “point-eye” that immediately observes
the differences of direction of the impinging rays, these directions
being the values of θ given by (15); the “point-eye” thus obtains
a picture of the directions in which the surrounding objects lie
(colour factors are ignored). The Law of Continuity governs not
only the action of physical things on one another but also psychophysical interactions. The direction in which we observe objects

To say that a material content G is the same as the material content G[′] can obviously mean no more than saying that to every
point of view P with respect to G there corresponds a point of
view P _[′]_ with respect to G[′] (and conversely) in such a way that
an observer at P _[′]_ in G[′] receives the same “direction-picture” as an
observer in G receives at P .
Let us take as a basis a definite co-ordinate system xi. The

co-ordinate system and the modes of expression

I shall show that if Riemann’s view is correct S[′] is congruent

I make use of a second co-ordinate system by taking as coordinates of the point P the values of x[′]i [given by][ (16)][; the ex-]
pressions (16) then become the formulæ of transformation. The
mathematical region in three variables represented by S in the
co-ordinates x[′] is identical with that represented by S[′] in the coordinates x. An arbitrary point P has the same co-ordinates in x[′]

as P _[′]_ has in x. I now imagine space to be filled by matter in some
other way, namely, that represented by the formulæ

_ρ = f_ (x[′]1[, x][′]2[, x][′]3[)]

at the point P, with similar formulæ for the other scalar quantities. If the metric relations of space are taken to be independent

metric relations of space are determined by the matter filling

assumed above, the content in the portion S[′] of space during the

observer at P _[′]_ as the material content in S during the second
occupation presents to an observer at P . If the older view of
“residential flats” is correct, this would of course not be the case.
The simple fact that I can squeeze a ball of modelling clay with
my hands into any irregular shape totally different from a sphere
would seem to reduce Riemann’s view to an absurdity. This, however, proves nothing. For if Riemann is right, a deformation of the
inner atomic structure of the clay is entirely different from that
which I can effect with my hands, and a rearrangement of the
masses in the universe, would be necessary to make the distorted
ball of clay appear spherical to an observer from all points of view.
The essential point is that a piece of space has no visual form at
all, but that this form depends on the material content occupying
the world, and, indeed, occupying it in such a way that by means
of an appropriate rearrangement of the mode of occupation I can
give it any visual form. By this I can also metamorphose any
two different pieces of space into the same visual form by choosing an appropriate disposition of the matter. Einstein helped to
lead Riemann’s ideas to victory (although he was not directly influenced by Riemann). Looking back from the stage to which
Einstein has brought us, we now recognise that these ideas could
give rise to a valid theory only after time had been added as a
fourth dimension to the three-space dimensions in the manner set
forth in the so-called special theory of relativity. As, according to
Riemann, the conception “congruence” leads to no metrical system at all, not even to the general metrical system of Riemann,

elsewhere. Einstein affirms that it is to be found in the “binding
forces” of Gravitation. In Einstein’s theory (Chapter IV) the
co-efficients gik of the metrical groundform play the same part
as does gravitational potential in Newton’s theory of gravitation.
The laws according to which space-filling matter determines the
metrical structure are the laws of gravitation. The gravitational
field affects light rays and “rigid” bodies used as measuring rods in
such a way that when we use these rods and rays in the usual manner to take measurements of objects, a geometry of measurement
is found to hold which deviates very little from that of Euclid in
the regions accessible to observation. These metric relations are
not the outcome of space being a form of phenomena, but of the
physical behaviour of measuring rods and light rays as determined
by the gravitational field.
After Riemann had made known his discoveries, mathematicians busied themselves with working out his system of geometrical ideas formally; chief among these were Christoffel, Ricci, and
Levi-Civita (vide note 8). Riemann, in the last words of the above
quotation, clearly left the real development of his ideas in the
hands of some subsequent scientist whose genius as a physicist
could rise to equal flights with his own as a mathematician. After
a lapse of seventy years this mission has been fulfilled by Einstein.
Inspired by the weighty inferences of Einstein’s theory to examine the mathematical foundations anew the present writer made
the discovery that Riemann’s geometry goes only half-way towards
attaining the ideal of a pure infinitesimal geometry. It still remains
to eradicate the last element of geometry “at a distance,” a remnant of its Euclidean past. Riemann assumes that it is possible


-----

p, ; **p** **p**
**a distance in an “infinitely near” geometry. One principle**
alone is allowable; by this a division of length is transferable from
one point to that infinitely adjacent to it.
After these introductory remarks we now pass on to the systematic development of pure infinitesimal geometry (vide note 9),
which will be traced through three stages; from the continuum,
which eludes closer definition, by way of affinely connected
**manifolds, to metrical space. This theory which, in my opin-**
ion, is the climax of a wonderful sequence of logically-connected
ideas, and in which the result of these ideas has found its ultimate
shape, is a true geometry, a doctrine of space itself and not merely
like Euclid, and almost everything else that has been done under
the name of geometry, a doctrine of the configurations that are
possible in space.

**§ 13. Tensors and Tensor-densities in any Arbitrary**
**Manifold**

**An n-dimensional Manifold.—Following the scheme out-**
lined above we shall make the sole assumption about space that it
is an n-dimensional continuum. It may accordingly be referred to
_n-co-ordinates x1, x2, . . ., xn, of which each has a definite numeri-_
cal value at each point of the manifold; different value-systems of
the co-ordinates correspond to different points. If ¯x1, ¯x2, . . . ¯xn is
a second system of co-ordinates, then there are certain relations

_xi = fi(¯x1, ¯x2, . . . ¯xn) where (i = 1, 2, . . ., n)_ (17)

between the x co ordinates and the ¯x co ordinates; these relations

whose determinant is non-vanishing. The latter condition is necessary and sufficient to make affine geometry hold in infinitely small
regions, that is, so that reversible linear relations exist between
the differentials of the co-ordinates in both systems, i.e.

�
_dxi =_ _αk[i]_ _[d][x][¯][k][.]_ (18)

_k_

We assume the existence and continuity of higher derivatives wherever we find it necessary to use them in the course of our investigation. In every case, then, a meaning which is invariant and
independent of the co-ordinate system has been assigned to the
conception of continuous functions of a point which have continuous first, second, third, or higher derivatives as required; the
co-ordinates themselves are such functions.
**Conception of a Tensor.—The relative co-ordinates dx of a**
point P _[′]_ = (xi + dxi) infinitely near to the point P = (xi) are the
components of a line element at P or of an infinitesimal dis**placement** _[−−→]PP_ _[′]_ of P . The transformation to another co-ordinate
system is effected for these components by formulæ (18), in which
_αk[i]_ [denote the values of the respective derivatives at the point][ P] [.]
The infinitesimal displacements play the same part in the development of Tensor Calculus as do displacements in Chapter I. It
must, however, be noticed that, here, a displacement is essen**tially bound to a point, and that there is no meaning in saying**
that the infinitesimal displacements of two different points are the

g p p q
they have the same components; but it is obvious from the fact
that the αk[i] [’s in][ (18)][ are not constants, that if this were the case]
for one co-ordinate system it need in no wise be true for another.
Consequently we may only speak of the infinitesimal displacement
of a point and not, as in Chapter I, of the whole of space; hence
we cannot talk of a vector or tensor simply, but must talk of a
**vector or tensor as being at a point P** . A tensor at a point P
is a linear form, in several series of variables, which is dependent
on a co-ordinate system to which the immediate neighbourhood
of P is referred in the following way: the expressions of the linear form in any two co-ordinate systems x and ¯x pass into one
another if certain of the series of variables (with upper indices)
are transformed co-grediently, the remainder (with lower indices)
contra-grediently, to the differentials dxi, according to the scheme

By αk[i] [we mean the values of these derivatives][ at the point][ P] [.]
The co-efficients of the linear form are called the components of
the tensor in the co-ordinate system under consideration; they are
co-variant in those indices that belong to the variables with an upper index, contra-variant in the remaining ones. The conception
of tensors is possible owing to the circumstance that the transition
from one co-ordinate system to another expresses itself as a lin**ear transformation in the differentials. One here uses the exceed-**
ingly fruitful mathematical device of making a problem “linear”
by reverting to infinitely small quantities. The whole of Tensor

contra-variant and co-variant vectors. Whenever the word vector
is used without being defined more exactly we shall understand
it as meaning a contra-variant vector. Infinitesimal quantities of
this type are the line elements in P . Associated with every coordinate system there are n “unit vectors” ei at P, namely, those
which have components

in linear terms of these unit vectors. For if ξ[i] are its components,
then
**x = ξ[1]e1 + ξ[2]e2 + · · · + ξ[n]en holds.**

The unit vectors ¯ei of another co-ordinate system ¯x are derived
from the ei’s according to the equations

**Conception of a Curve.—If to every value of a parameter s**
a point P = P (s) is assigned in a continuous manner, then if we
interpret s as time, a “motion” is given. In default of a better
expression we shall apply this name in a purely mathematical
sense, even when we do not interpret s in this way. If we use a
definite co-ordinate system we may represent the motion in the
form
_xi = xi(s)_ (20)

by means of n continuous functions xi(s), which we assume not
only to be continuous, but also continuously differentiable.[∗] In
passing from the parametric value s to s + ds, the corresponding point P suffers an infinitesimal displacement having components dxi. If we divide this vector at P by ds, we get the “ve
**locity,” a vector at P having components** _[dx][i]_

_ds_ [=][ u][i][. The for-]

mulæ (20) is at the same time a parametric representation of the
**trajectory of the motion. Two motions describe the same curve**
if, and only if, the one motion arises from the other when the parameter s is subjected to a transformation s = ω(¯s), in which ω is
a continuous and continuously differentiable uniform function ω.
Not the components of velocity at a point are determinate for a
curve, but only their ratios (which characterise the direction of
the curve).
**Tensor Analysis.—A tensor field of a certain kind is de-**
fined in a region of space if to every point P of this region a tensor

g y y
the components of the tensor field appear as definite functions of
the co-ordinates of the variable “point of emergence” P : we assume them to be continuous and to have continuous derivatives.
The Tensor Analysis worked out in Chapter I, § 8, cannot, without
alteration, be applied to any arbitrary continuum. For in defining the general process of differentiation we earlier used arbitrary
co-variant and contra-variant vectors, whose components were in**dependent of the point in question. This condition is indeed**
invariable for linear transformations, but not for any arbitrary
ones since, in these, the αk[i] [’s are not constants. For an arbitrary]
manifold we may, therefore, set up only the analysis of linear
tensor fields: this we proceed to show. Here, too, there is derived
from a scalar field f by means of differentiation, independently
of the co-ordinate system, a linear tensor field of the first order
having components

_fi =_ _[∂f]_ _._ (21)

_∂xi_

From a linear tensor field fi of the first order we get one of the
second order
_fik =_ _[∂f][i]_ _−_ _[∂f][k]_ _._ (22)

_∂xk_ _∂xi_

From one of the second order, fik, we get a linear tensor field of
the third order

and so forth.

From this we see that the _[∂f]_ ’s are components of a co-variant

_∂xi_

tensor field of the first order, which is derived from the scalar
field φ in a manner independent of all co-ordinate systems. We
have here a simple illustration of the conception of vector fields.
At the same time we see that the operation “grad” is invariant
not only for linear transformations, but also for any arbitrary
transformations of the co-ordinates whatsoever, and this is what
we enunciated.
To arrive at (22) we perform the following construction. From
the point P = P00 we draw the two line elements with components dxi and δxi, which lead to the two infinitely near points P10
and P01. We displace (by “variation”) the line element dx in some
way so that its point of emergence describes the distancesuppose it to have got to _[−−−−→]P01P11 finally. We shall call this pro- P00P01;_
cess the displacement δ. Let the components dxi have increased
by δdxi, so that

_δdxi =_ �xi(P11) − _xi(P01)�_ _−_ �xi(P10) − _xi(P00)�._

We now interchange d and δ By an analogous displacement d of


-----

position P10P11, its components are increased by

_dδxi =_ �xi(P11[′] [)][ −] _[x][i][(][P][10][)]�_ _−_ �xi(P01) − _xi(P00)�._

Hence it follows that

_δdxi −_ _dδxi = xi(P11) −_ _xi(P11[′]_ [)][.] (24)

If, and only if, the two points P11 and P11[′] [coincide, i.e. if the]
two line elements dx and δx sweep out the same infinitesimal
“parallelogram” during their displacements δ and d respectively—
that is how we shall view it—then we shall have

_δdxi −_ _dδxi = 0._ (25)

If, now, a co-variant vector field with components fi is given,
then we form the change in the invariant df = fi dxi owing to the
displacement δ thus:

_δdf = δfi dxi + fi δdxi._

Interchanging d and δ, and then subtracting, we get

∆f = (δd − _dδ)f = (δfi dxi −_ _dfi δxi) + fi(δdxi −_ _dδxi)_

and if both displacements pass over the same infinitesimal parallelogram we get, in particular,

argument will run as follows. Let a point (s, t) of our manifold be
assigned to every pair of values of two parameters s, t (in a certain
region encircling s = 0, t = 0). Let the functions xi = xi(s, t),
which represents this “two-dimensional motion” (extending over a
surface) in any co-ordinate system xi, have continuous first and
second differential co-efficients. For every point (s, t) there are two

velocity vectors with components _[dx][i]_ _[dx][i]_

_ds_ [and] _dt_ [. We may assign our]

parameters so that a prescribed point P = (0, 0) corresponds to
_s = 0, t = 0, and that the two velocity vectors at it coincide with_
two arbitrarily given vectors u[i], v[i] (for this it is merely necessary
to make the xi’s linear functions of s and t). Let d denote the

infinitesimal parallelograms into which the surface xi = xi(s, t) is
divided by the co-ordinate lines s = const. and t = const.
**Stokes’ Theorem may be recalled in this connection. The**
invariant linear differential fi dxi is called integrable if its integral
along every closed curve (its “curl”) = 0. (This is true, as we know,
only for a total differential.) Let any arbitrary surface given in
a parametric form xi = xi(s, t) be spread out within the closed
curve, and be divided into infinitesimal parallelograms by the coordinate lines. The curl taken around the perimeter of the whole
surface may then be traced back to the single curls around these
little surface meshes, and their values are given for every mesh
by our expression (27), after it has been multiplied by ds dt. A
differential division of the curl is produced in this way, and the
tensor (22) is a measure of the “intensity of the curl” at every
point.
In the same way we pass on to the next higher stage (23).
In place of the infinitesimal parallelogram we now use the threedimensional parallelepiped mapped out by the three line elements
_d, δ, and ∂._ We shall just indicate the steps of the argument
briefly.

_dx represents briefly the element of integration dx1 dx2 . . . dxn, is_
an invariant integral, then W is a quantity dependent on the coordinate system in such a way that, when transformed to another
co-ordinate system, its value become multiplied by the absolute
(numerical) value of the functional determinant. If we regard this
integral as a measure of the quantity of substance occupying the
region of integration, then W is its density. We may, therefore,
call a quantity of the kind described a scalar-density.
This is an important conception, equally as valuable as the
conception of scalars; it cannot be reduced to the latter. In an
analogous sense we may speak of tensor-densities as well as
scalar-densities. A linear form of several series of variables which
is dependent on the co-ordinate system, some of the variables carrying upper indices, others lower ones, is a tensor-density at a
point P, if, when the expression for this linear form is known for
a given co-ordinate system, its expression for any other arbitrary
co-ordinate system, distinguished by bars, is obtained by multiplying it with the absolute or numerical value of the functional
determinant

∆= abs. |αi[k][|] i.e. the absolute value of |αi[k][|][,]

and by transforming the variable according to the old scheme (19).
The words, components, co-variant, contra-variant, symmetrical,
skew-symmetrical, field, and so forth, are used exactly as in the
case of tensors. By contrasting tensors and tensor-densities, it
seems to me that we have grasped rigorously the difference between quantity and intensity, so far as this difference has a
physical meaning: tensors are the magnitudes of intensity

among tensor-densities by contra-variant symmetrical tensordensities, which we shall term briefly linear tensor-densities.
**Algebra of Tensor-densities.—As in the realm of tensors**
so have here the following operations:—
1. Addition of tensor-densities of the same type; multiplication
of a tensor-density by a number.
2. Contraction.
3. Multiplication of a tensor by a tensor-density (not multiplication of two tensor-densities by each other). For, if two scalardensities, for example, were to be multiplied together, the result
would not again be a scalar-density but a quantity which, to be
transformed to another co-ordinate system, would have to be multiplied by the square of the functional determinant. Multiplying
a tensor by a tensor-density, however, always leads to a tensordensity (whose order is equal to the sum of the orders of both
factors). Thus, for example, if a contra-variant vector with components f _[i]_ and a co-variant tensor-density with components wik
be multiplied together, we get a mixed tensor-density of the third
order with components f _[i]wkl produced in a manner independent_
of the co-ordinate system.
**The analysis of tensor-densities can be established only**
for linear fields in the case of an arbitrary manifold. It leads
to the following processes resembling the operation of
**divergence:—**

_∂w[i]_

. . . . . . . . . .

As a result of (30) a linear tensor-density field w[i] of the first order
gives rise to a scalar-density field w, whereas (31) produces from
a linear field of the second order (w[ki] = −w[ik]) a linear field of
the first order, and so forth. These operations are independent of
the co-ordinate system. The divergence (30) of a field w[i] of the
first order which has been produced from one, w[ik], of the second
order by means of (31) is = 0; an analogous result holds for the
higher orders. To prove that (30) is invariant, we use the following
known result of the theory of the motion of continuously extended
masses.
If ξ[i] is a given vector field, then

_x¯i = xi + ξ[i]_ _· δt_ (32)

expresses an infinitesimal displacement of the points of the
continuum, by which the point with the co-ordinates xi is transferred to the point with the co-ordinates ¯xi. Let the constant infinitesimal factor δt be defined as the element of time during which
the deformation takes place. The determinant of transformation

for the arguments ¯xi of s. (I am here displacing the volume with
respect to the substance; instead of this, we can of course make
the substance flow through the volume; sξ[i] then represents the
intensity of the current.) The increase in the amount of substance
that the region G gains by the displacement is given by the integral s(¯x)A − **s(x) taken with respect to the variables xi over X.**
We, however, get for the integrand

Consequently the formula

establishes an invariant connection between the two scalar-density

For this integral, multiplied by δt, signifies the change that the

The invariance of the process of divergence (30) enables us
easily to advance to further stages, the next being (31). We enlist
the help of a co-variant vector field fi, which has been derived
from a potential f ; i.e.

_fi =_ _[∂f]_ _._

We then form the linear tensor-density w[ik]fi of the first order and
also its divergence

**The Conception of Affine Relationship** We shall call a

by a parallel displacement from P to P _[′]; P_ _[′]_ is here an arbitrary
point infinitely near P (vide note 10). No more and no less is
required of this conception than that it is endowed with all the
properties that were ascribed to it in the affine geometry of Chapter I. That is, we postulate: There is a co-ordinate system (for the
_immediate neighbourhood of P_ _) such that, in it, the components_
_of any vector at P are not altered by an infinitesimal parallel dis-_
_placement. This postulate characterises parallel displacements as_
being such that they may rightly be regarded as leaving vectors
**unchanged. Such co-ordinate systems are called geodetic at P** .
What is the effect of this in an arbitrary co-ordinate system xi?
Let us suppose that, in it, the point P has the co-ordinate x[0]i [,]
_P_ _[′]_ the co-ordinates x[0]i [+][ dx][i][; let][ ξ][i][ be the components of an arbi-]
trary vector at P, ξ[i] + dξ[i] the components of the vector resulting
from it by parallel displacement towards P _[′]. Firstly, since the par-_
allel displacement from P to P _[′]_ causes all the vectors at P to be
mapped out linearly or affinely by all the vectors at P _[′], dξ[i]_ must
be linearly dependent on ξ[i], i.e.

_dξ[i]_ = −dγr[i][ξ][r][.] (33)

Secondly, as a consequence of the postulate with which we started,
the dγr[i][’s must be linear forms of the differentials][ dx][i][, i.e.]

_dγr[i]_ [=][ Γ]rs[i] _[dx][s]_ (33[′])

in which the number co-efficients Γ, the “components of the affine
relationship,” satisfy the condition of symmetry


-----

p, _i_ g y ;
formulæ of transformation (17) and (18) then hold. It follows
from the geodetic character of the co-ordinate system ¯xi that, for
a parallel displacement,

_dξ[i]_ = d(αr[i] _[ξ][¯][r][) =][ dα]r[i]_ _[ξ][¯][r][.]_

If we regard the ξ[i]’s as components δxi of a line element at P we
must have

_∂[2]fi_
_−dγr[i]_ _[δx][r]_ [=] _δx¯r dx¯s_
_∂x¯r ∂x¯s_

(in the case of the second derivatives we must of course insert their
values at P ). The statement contained in our enunciation follows
directly from this. Moreover, the symmetrical bilinear form

_∂[2]fi_
_−Γ[i]rs_ _[δ][x][¯][r]_ _[d][x][¯][s]_ is derived from _δx¯r dx¯s_ (34)
_∂x¯r ∂x¯s_

by transformation according to (18). This exhausts all the aspects
of the question. Now, if Γ[i]rs [are arbitrarily given numbers that]
satisfy the condition of symmetry (33[′′]), and if we define the affine
relationship by (33) and (33[′]), the transformation formulæ lead to

_xi −_ _x[0]i_ [= ¯][x][i] _[−]_ 2[1] [Γ]rs[i] _[x][¯][r][x][¯][s][,]_

that is, to a geodetic co-ordinate system ¯xi at P, since the equations (34) are fulfilled for them at P . In fact this transformation
at P gives us

affine relationship are transformed in passing from one co-ordinate
system to another may easily be obtained from the above discussion; we do not, however, require them for subsequent work. The
Γ’s are certainly not components of a tensor (contra-variant in i,
co-variant in r and s) at the point P ; they have this character
with regard to linear transformations, but lose it when subjected
to arbitrary transformations. For they all vanish in a geodetic
co-ordinate system. Yet every virtual change of the affine relationship [Γ[i]rs[]][, whether it be finite or “infinitesimal,” is a tensor.]
For

[dξ[i]] = [Γ[i]rs[]][ξ][r][ dx][s]
is the difference of the two vectors that arise as a result of the two
parallel displacements of the vector ξ from P to P _[′]._
The meaning of the parallel displacement of a co-variant
**vector ξi at the point P to the infinitely near point P** _[′]_ is defined uniquely by the postulate that the invariant product ξiη[i] of
the vector ξi and any arbitrary contra-variant vector η[i] remain
unchanged after the simultaneous parallel displacements, i.e.

_d(ξiη[i]) = (dξi · η[i]) + (ξr dη[r]) = (dξi −_ _dγi[r]_ _[ξ][r][)][η][i][ = 0][,]_

whence

remark will be used in a construction which is to be carried out in

From now onwards we shall occupy ourselves with affine man**ifolds; they are such that every point of them is affinely**
**related to its neighbourhood. For a definite co-ordinate sys-**
tem the components Γ[i]rs [of the affine relationship are continuous]
functions of the co-ordinates xi. By selecting the appropriate coordinate system the Γ[i]rs[’s may, of course, be made to vanish at a]
single point P, but it is, in general, not possible to achieve this simultaneously for all points of the manifold. There is no difference
in the nature of any of the affine relationships holding between
the various points of the manifold and their immediate neighbourhood. The manifold is homogeneous in this sense. There are
not various types of manifolds capable of being distinguished by
the nature of the affine relationships governing each kind. The
postulate with which we set out admits of only one definite kind
of affine relationship.

tor (which is arbitrarily variable) with it, we get for every value
of the time parameter s not only a point

_P = (s) : x = xi(s)_

of the manifold, but also a vector at this point with components
_v[i]_ = v[i](s) dependent on s. The vector remains stationary at the
moment s if

with differentials; they have here been converted into differential
co-efficients.) In the case of a vector being carried along according
to any arbitrary rule, the left-hand side V _[i]_ of (36) consists of
the components of a vector in (s) connected invariantly with the
motion and indicating how much the vector v[i] changes per unit
of time at this point. For in passing from the point P = (s) to
_P_ _[′]_ = (s + ds), the vector v[i] at P becomes the vector

_v[i]_ + _[dv][i]_

_ds [ds]_

at P _[′]. If, however, we displace v[i]_ from P to P _[′]_ leaving it unchanged, we there get

_v[i]_ + δv[i] = v[i] _−_ Γ[i]αβ _[v][α][ dx][β][.]_

Accordingly, the difference between these two vectors at P _[′], the_
change in v during the time ds has components

_dv[i]_

_ds [ds][ −]_ _[δv][i][ =][ V][ i][ ds.]_

In analytical language the invariant character of the vector V may
be recognised most readily as follows. Let us take an arbitrary
auxiliary co-variant vector ξi = (s) at P, and let us form the
change in the invariant ξiv[i] in its passage from (s) to (s + ds),
whereby the vector ξi is taken along unchanged. We get

_d(ξiv[i])_ = ξiV _[i]._

_ds_

If V vanishes for every value of s, the vector v glides with the
point P along the trajectory during the motion without becoming


-----

Every motion is accompanied by the vector u = ds of its
velocity; for this particular case, V is the vector

_U_ _[i]_ = _[du][i]_ _αβ_ _[u][α][u][β][ =]_ _[d][2][x]_ _αβ_ _dxα_ _dxβ_

_ds_ [+][ Γ][i] _ds[2][ +][ Γ][i]_ _ds_ _ds_ [:]


namely, the acceleration, which is a measure of the change of
velocity per unit of time. A motion, in the course of which the
velocity remains unchanged throughout, is called a translation.
The trajectory of a translation, being a curve which preserves its
direction unchanged, is a straight or geodetic line. According
to the translational view (cf. Chapter I, § 1) this is the inherent
property of the straight line.
**The analysis of tensors and tensor-densities may be de-**
veloped for an affine manifold just as simply and completely as
for the linear geometry of Chapter I. For example, if fi[k] [are the]
components (co-variant in i, contra-variant in k) of a tensor field
of the second order, we take two auxiliary arbitrary vectors at the
point P, of which the one, ξ, is contra-variant and the other, η, is
co-variant, and form the invariant

_fi[k][ξ][i][η][k]_

and its change for an infinitesimal displacement d of the current
point P, by which ξ and η are displaced parallel to themselves.
Now

_d(fi[k][ξ][i][η][k][) =]_ _[∂f]i[ k]_ _ξ[i]ηk dxl −_ _fr[k][η][k]_ _[dγ]i[r]_ _[ξ][i][ +][ f]i[ r][ξ][i][ dγ]r[k]_ _[η][k][,]_

hence
_∂f_ _[k]_


-----

p,
in i, l and contra-variant in k: this tensor field is derived from
the given one of the second order by a process independent of the
co-ordinate system. The additional terms, which the components
of the affine relationship contain, are characteristic quantities in
which, following Einstein, we shall later recognise the influence of
the gravitational field. The method outlined enables us to differentiate a tensor in every conceivable case.
Just as the operation “grad” plays the fundamental part in
tensor analysis and all other operations are derivable from it, so
the operation “div” defined by (30) is the basis of the analysis of
tensor-densities. The latter leads to processes of a similar character for tensor-densities of any order. For instance, if we wish to
find an expression for the divergence of a mixed tensor-density wi[k]
of the second order, we make use of an auxiliary stationary vector
field ξ[i]wi[k] [at][ P][ and find the divergence of the tensor-density][ ξ][i][w]i[k][:]


_∂(ξ[i]wi[k][)]_ _i_ � _i_

_∂xk_ _∂xk_ _∂xk_ _∂xk_


�
_._


This quantity is a scalar-density, and since the components of a
vector field which is stationary at P may assume any values at
this point (P ), namely,

_∂wi[k]_ _−_ Γ[r]is[w]r[s][,] (37)
_∂xk_

it is a co-variant tensor-density of the first order which has been
derived from wi[k] [in a manner independent of every co-ordinate]
system.
Moreover not only can we reduce a tensor density to one of


-----

p y
higher order by differentiation. Let s denote a scalar-density,
and let us again use a stationary vector field ξ[i] at P : we then
form the divergence of current-density, sξ[i]:

_∂(sξ[i])_ � _∂s_ �

= _[∂][s]_ _ξ[i]_ + s _[∂ξ][i]_ = _−_ Γ[r]ir[s] _ξ[i]._
_∂xi_ _∂xi_ _∂xi_ _∂xi_


We thus get
_∂s_
_−_ Γ[r]ir[s]
_∂xi_

as the components of a co-variant vector-density. To extend differentiation beyond scalar tensor-densities to any tensor-densities
whatsoever, for example, to the mixed tensor-density wi[k] of
the second order, we again proceed, as has been done repeatedly above, to make use of two stationary vector fields at P,
namely, ξ[i] and η[i], the latter being co-variant and the former
contra-variant. We differentiate the scalar-density wi[k][ξ][i][η][k][.] If
the tensor-density that has been derived by differentiation be
contracted with respect to the symbol of differentiation and one
of the contra-variant indices, the divergence is again obtained.

**§ 15. Curvature**

If P and P _[∗]_ are two points connected by a curve, and if a vector
is given at P, then this vector may be moved parallel to itself along
the curve from P to P _[∗]. Equations (36), giving the unknown com-_
ponents v[i] of the vector which is being subjected to a continuous
parallel displacement, have, for given initial values of v[i], one and
only one solution The vector transference that comes about in


-----

g p p p g
which the transference is effected. Only in the particular case,
in which integrability occurs, is it allowable to speak of the same
vector at two different points P and P _[∗]; this comprises those vec-_
tors that are generated from one another by parallel displacement.
Let such a manifold be called Euclidean-affine. If we subject all
points of such a manifold to an infinitesimal displacement, which
is in each case representable by an “equal” infinitesimal vector,
then the space is said to have undergone an infinitesimal total
**translation. With the help of this conception, and following the**
line of reasoning of Chapter I. (without entering on a rigorous
proof), we may construct “linear” co-ordinate systems which are
characterised by the fact that, in them, the same vectors have the
same components at different points of the systems. In a linear
co-ordinate system the components of the affine relationship vanish identically. Any two such systems are connected by linear
formulæ of transformation. The manifold is then an affine space
in the sense of Chapter I.: The integrability of the vector transfer_ence is the infinitesimal geometrical property which distinguishes_
_“linear” spaces among affinely related spaces._
We must now turn our attention to the general case; it must
not be expected in this that a vector that has been taken round a
closed curve by parallel displacement finally returns to its initial
position. Just as in the proof of Stokes’s Theorem, so here we
stretch a surface over the closed curve and divide it into infinitely
small parallelograms by parametric lines. The change in any arbitrary vector after it has traversed the periphery of the surface
is reduced to the change effected after it has traversed each of the
infinitesimal parallelograms marked out by two line elements dxi


-----

p ( _ξ ),_ y
which a vector x = ξ[i] increases, is derived from x by a linear
transformation, a matrix ∆F, i.e.

∆x = ∆F(x); ∆ξ[α] = ∆Fβ[α] _[·][ ξ][β][.]_ (38)

If ∆F = 0, then the manifold is “plane” at the point P in the
surface direction assumed by the surface element; if this is true for
all elements of a finitely extended portion of surface, then every
vector that is subjected to parallel displacement along the edge
of the surface returns finally to its initial position. ∆F is linearly
dependent on the element of surface:

∆F = Fik dxi δxk = [1]2 **[F][ik][∆][x][ik]** (∆xik = dxi δxk − _dxk δxi,_

and
**Fki = −Fik).** (39)

The differential form that occurs here characterises the curva**ture, that is, the deviation of the manifold from plane-ness at**
the point P for all possible directions of the surface; since its
co-efficients are not numbers, but matrices, we might well speak
of a “linear matrix-tensor of the second order,” and this would
undoubtedly best characterise the quantitative nature of curvature. If, however, we revert from the matrices back to their
components—supposing Fβik[α] [to be the components of][ F][ik][ or else]
the co-efficients of the form

∆Fβ[α] [=][ F]βik[ α] _[dx][i]_ _[δx][k]_ (40)

—then we arrive at the formula


-----

_βik_ p
of the fourth order which is contra-variant in α and co-variant in
_β, i and k. Expressed in terms of the components Γ[i]rs_ [of the affine]
relationship, it is


_Fβik[α]_ [=] � _∂Γαβk_ _−_ _[∂][Γ]βi[α]_
_∂xi_ _∂xk_


�
+ (Γ[α]ri[Γ][r]βk _[−]_ [Γ]rk[α] [Γ][r]βi[)][.] (42)


According to this they fulfil the conditions of “skew” and “cyclical”
symmetry, namely:—

_Fβki[α]_ [=][ −][F]βik[ α] [;] _Fβik[α]_ [+][ f]ikβ[ α] [+][ F]kβi[ α] [= 0][.] (43)

The vanishing of the curvature is the invariant differential law
which distinguishes Euclidean spaces among affine spaces in terms
of general infinitesimal geometry.
To prove the statements above enunciated we use the same
process of sweeping twice over an infinitesimal parallelogram as
we used on page 157 to derive the curl tensor; we use the same
notation as on that occasion. Let a vector x = x(P00) with components ξ[i] be given at the point P00. The vector x(P10) that is
derived from x(P00) by parallel displacement along the line element dx is attached to the end point P10 of the same line element.
If the components of x(P10) are ξ[i] + dξ[i] then

_dξ[α]_ = −dγβ[α] _[ξ][β][ =][ −][Γ]βi[α]_ _[ξ][β][ dx][i][.]_

Throughout the displacement δ to which the line element dx is
to be subjected (and which need by no means be a parallel displacement) let the vector at the end point be bound always by the
specified condition to the vector at the initial point. The dξ[α]’s are
then increased, owing to the displacement, by an amount


-----

, p, p
remains parallel to itself during the displacement, then δξ[r] must
be replaced in this formula by −δγβ[r] _[ξ][β][.]_ In the final position
_−−−−→_
_P01P11 of the line element we then get, at the point P01, the vec-_
tor x(P01), which is derived from x(P00) by parallel displacement
along _[−−−−→]P00P01; at P11 we get the vector x(P11), into which x(P01) is_
converted by parallel displacement along _[−−−−→]P01P11, and we have_

_δdξ[α]_ = �ξ[α](P11) − _ξ[α](P01)�_ _−_ �ξ[α](P10) − _ξ[α](P00)�._

If the vector that is derived from x(P10) by parallel displacement
along _[−−−−→]P10P11 is denoted by x∗P11, then, by interchanging d and δ,_
we get an analogous expression for

_dδξ[α]_ = �ξ[α] � _−_ �ξ[α](P01) − _ξ[α](P00)�._
_∗_ [(][P][11][)][ −] _[ξ][α][(][P][10][)]_

By subtraction we get

∆ξ[α] = δdξ[α] _−_ _dδξ[α]_

Since δdxi = dδxi the two last terms on the right destroy one
another, and we are left with

∆ξ[α] = ∆Fβ[α] _[·][ ξ][β]_

in which the ∆ξ[α]’s are the components of a vector ∆x at P11,

this proves the statements enunciated above.
The foregoing argument, based on infinitesimals, become rigorous as soon as we interpret d and δ in terms of the differentiations
_d_ _[d]_
_ds_ [and] _dt[, as was done earlier. To trace the various stages of the]_

vector x during the sequence of infinitesimal displacements, we
may well adopt the following plan. Let us ascribe to every pair of
values s, t, not only a point P = (s, t), but also a co-variant vector
at P with components fi(s, t). If ξ[i] is an arbitrary vector at P,

then d(fiξ[i]) signifies the value that _[d][(][f][i][ξ][i][)]_ assumes if ξ[i] is taken

_ds_

along unchanged from the point (s, t) to the point (s + _ds, t). And_
_d(fiξ[i]) is itself again an expression of the form fiξ[i]_ excepting that
instead of fi there are now other functions fi[′] [of][ s][ and][ t][. We may,]
therefore, again subject it to the same process, or to the analogous
one δ. If we do the latter, and repeat the whole operation in the
reverse order, and then subtract, we get

_δd(fiξ[i]) = δdfi ξ[i]_ + dfi δξ[i] + δfi dξ[i] + fi δdξ[i],

and then, since


_δdfi =_ _[d][2][f][i]_ _[d][2][f][i]_

_dt ds_ [=] _ds dt_ [=][ dδf][i][,]

we have
∆(fiξ[i]) = (δd − _dδ)(fiξ[i]) = fi ∆ξ[i]._

In the last expression ∆ξ[i] is precisely the expression found above.
The invariant obtained is, for the point P = (0, 0),

at this point, and on three contra-variant vectors ξ, u, v; the Fβik[α] [’s]
are accordingly the components of a tensor of the fourth order.

**§ 16. Metrical Space**

**The Conception of Metrical Manifolds.—A manifold has**
**a measure-determination at the point P**, if the line elements at P may be compared with respect to length; we herein
assume that the Pythagorean law (of Euclidean geometry) is valid
for infinitesimal regions. Every vector x then defines a distance
_at P_ _; and there is a non-degenerate quadratic form x[2], such that_
**x and vy define the same distance if, and only if, x[2]** = y[2]. This
postulate determines the quadratic form fully, if a factor of proportionality differing from zero be prefixed. The fixing of the
latter serves to calibrate the manifold at the point P . We shall
then call x[2] the measure of the vector x, or since it depends only
on the distance defined by x, we may call it the measure l of
**this distance. Unequal distances have different measures; the**
distances at a point P therefore constitute a one-dimensional totality. If we replace this calibration by another, the new measure [¯]l
is derived from the old one l by multiplying it by a constant factor λ ̸= 0, independent of the distance; that is, [¯]l = λl. The
relations between the measures of the distances are independent
of the calibration. So we see that just as the characterisation of
a vector at P by a system of numbers (its components) depends
on the choice of the co-ordinate system, so the fixing of a distance
by a number depends on the calibration; and just as the components of a vector undergo a homogeneous linear transformation in


-----

y
two vectors x and y (at P ), for which the symmetrical bilinear
form x · y corresponding to x[2] vanishes, perpendicular to one
another; this reciprocal relation is not affected by the calibration
factor. The fact that the form x[2] is definite is of no account in our
subsequent mathematical propositions, but, nevertheless, we wish
to keep this case uppermost in our minds in the sequel. If this
form has p positive and q negative dimensions (p + q = n), we say
that the manifold is (p + q)-dimensional at the point in question.
If p ̸= q we fix the sign of the metrical fundamental form x[2] once
and for all by the postulate that p > q; the calibration ratio λ is
then always positive. After choosing a definite co-ordinate system
and a certain calibration factor, suppose that, for every vector x
with components ξ[i], we have

�
**x[2]** = _gikξ[i]ξ[k]_ (gki = gik). (44)

_i,k_

**We now assume that our manifold has a measure-**
**determination at every point. Let us calibrate it everywhere,**
and insert in the manifold a system of n co-ordinates xi—we must
do this so as to be able to express in numbers all quantities that
occur—then the gik’s in (44) are perfectly definite functions of the
co-ordinates xi; we assume that these functions are continuous
and differentiable. Since the determinant of the gik’s vanishes at
no point, the integral numbers p and q will remain the same in
the whole domain of the manifold; we assume that p > q.
For a manifold to be a metrical space, it is not sufficient for it
to have a measure-determination at every point; in addition, every
point must be metrically related to the domain surrounding it


-----

p; j,
former deals with distances. A point is thus metrically related
to the domain in its immediate neighbourhood, if the distance is
known to which every distance at P gives rise when it passes by a
congruent displacement from P to any point P _[′]_ infinitely near P .
The immediate vicinity of P may be calibrated in such a way
that the measure of any distance at P has undergone no change
after congruent displacements to infinitely near points. Such a
calibration is called geodetic at P . If, however, the manifold is
calibrated in any way, and if l is the measure of any arbitrary
distance at P, and l+dl the measure of the distance at P _[′]_ resulting
from a congruent displacement to the infinitely near point P _[′],_
there is necessarily an equation

_dl = −l dφ_ (45)

in which the infinitesimal factor dφ is independent of the displaced
distance, for the displacement effects a representation of the distances at P similar to that at P _[′]._ In (45), dφ corresponds to
the dγr[i][’s in the formula for vector displacements][ (33)][. If the cal-]
ibration is altered at P and its neighbouring points according to
the formula [¯]l = lλ (the calibration ratio λ is a positive function
of the position), we get in place of (45)

_d[¯]l = −[¯]l dφ[¯] in which dφ[¯] = dφ −_ _[dλ]_ (46)

_λ [.]_

The necessary and sufficient condition that an appropriate value
of λ make dφ[¯] vanish identically at P with respect to the infinitesimal displacement _[−−→]PP_ _[′]_ = (dxi) is clearly that dφ must be a differential form that is


-----

y p
at the outset are exhausted in (45) and (45[′]). (In short, the φi’s
are definite numbers at the point P . If P has co-ordinates xi = 0,
we need only assume log λ equal to the linear function _φixi_

[�]
to get dφ = 0 there.) All points of the manifold are identical
as regards the measure-determinations governing each and as regards their metrical relationship with their neighbouring points.
Yet, according as n is even or odd, there are respectively _[n]_

2 [+ 1]

or _[n][ + 1]_ different types of metrical manifolds which are distin
2
guishable from one another by the inertial index of the metrical
groundform. One kind, with which we shall occupy ourselves particularly, is given by the case in which p = n, q = 0 (or p = 0,
_q = n); other cases are p = n −_ 1, q = 1 (or p = 1, q = n − 1), or
_p = n −_ 2, q = 2 (or p = 2, q = n − 2), and so forth.
We may summarise our results thus. The metrical character
_of a manifold is characterised relatively to a system of reference_
(= co-ordinate system + calibration) by two fundamental forms,
_namely, a quadratic differential form Q =_ [�]i,k _[g][ik][ dx][i][ dx][k][ and a]_

_linear one dφ =_ [�]i _[φ][i][ dx][i][. They remain invariant during transfor-]_

_mations to new co-ordinate systems. If the calibration is changed,_
_the first form receives a factor λ, which is a positive function of_
_position with continuous derivatives, whereas the second function_
_becomes diminished by the differential of log λ. Accordingly all_
quantities or relations that represent metrical conditions analytically must contain the functions gikφi in such a way that invariance holds (1) for any transformation of co-ordinate (co-ordinate
_invariance), (2) for the substitution which replaces gik and φi re-_


-----

p y y

_λ · gik_ and _φi −_ [1] _[∂λ]_

_λ_ _[·]_ _∂xi_

no matter, in (2), what function of the co-ordinates λ may be.
(This may be termed calibration invariance.)
In the same way as in § 15, in which we determined the change
in a vector which, remaining parallel to itself, traverses the periphery of an infinitesimal parallelogram bounded by dxi, δxi, so
here we calculate the change ∆l in the measure l of a distance
subjected to an analogous process. Making use of dl = −l dφ we
get
_δdl = −δl dφ −_ _l δdφ = l δφ dφ −_ _l δdφ,_


i.e.
∆l = δdl − _dδl = −l ∆φ_

where

∆φ = (δd − _dδ)φ = fik dxi δxk_ and _fik =_ _[∂φ][i]_ _−_ _[∂φ][k]_ _._ (47)

_∂xk_ _∂xi_


Hence we may call the linear tensor of the second order with components fik the distance curvature of metrical space as an analogy
to the vector curvature of affine space, which was derived in § 15.
Equation (46) confirms analytically that the distance curvature is
independent of the calibration; it satisfies the equations of invariance
_∂fkl_

+ _[∂f][li]_ + _[∂f][ik]_ = 0.
_∂xi_ _∂xk_ _∂xl_

_Its vanishing is the necessary and sufficient condition that every_
_distance may be transferred from its initial position in a manner_

y p
**mann space, there is meaning in speaking of the same distance**
at different points of space; the manifold may then be calibrated
(normal calibration) so that dφ vanishes identically. (Indeed, it
follows from fik = 0, that dφ is a total differential, namely, the
differential of a function log λ; by re-calibrating in the calibration
ratio λ, dφ may then be made equal to zero everywhere.) In normal calibration the metrical groundform Q of Riemann’s space is
determined except for an arbitrary constant factor, which may
be fixed by choosing once and for all a unit distance (no matter at
which point; the normal meter may be transported to any place).
**The Affine Relationship of a Metrical Space.—We now**
arrive at a fact, which may almost be called the key-note of in**finitesimal geometry, inasmuch as it leads the logic of geometry**
to a wonderfully harmonious conclusion. In a metrical space the
conception of infinitesimal parallel displacements may be given in
only one way if, in addition to our previous postulate, it is also to
satisfy the almost self-evident one: parallel displacement of a vec_tor must leave unchanged the distance which it determines. Thus,_
_the principle of transference of distances or lengths which is the_
_basis of metrical geometry, carries with it a principle of trans-_
_ference of direction; in other words, an affine relationship is_
**inherent in metrical space.**
_Proof.—We take a definite system of reference. In the case_
of all quantities a[i] which carry an upper index i (not necessarily
excluding others) we shall define the lowering of the index by

transformed into the vector ξ[i] + dξ[i] at P _[′]_ = (xi + dxi) by the

and the equation

These components of the affine relationship fulfil all the postulates
that have been enunciated. It is in the nature of metrical space to
be furnished with this affine relationship; in virtue of it the whole
analysis of tensors and tensor-densities with all the conceptions
worked out above, such as geodetic line, curvature, etc., may be
applied to metrical space. If the curvature vanishes identically,
the space is metrical and Euclidean in the sense of Chapter I.
In the case of vector curvature we have still to derive an
important decomposition into components, by means of which we
prove that distance curvature is an inherent constituent of the
former. This is quite to be expected since vector transference is
automatically accompanied by distance transference. If we use the
symbol ∆= δd − _dδ relating to parallel displacement as before,_
then the measure l of a vector ξ[i] satisfies

∆l = −l ∆φ, ∆ξiξ[i] = −(ξiξ[i]) ∆φ. (47)

Just as we found for the case in which fi are any functions of
position that
∆(fiξ[i]) = fi ∆ξ[i]

so we see that

∆(ξiξ[i]) = ∆(gikξ[i]ξ[k]) = gik ∆ξ[i] _· ξ[k]_ + gikξ[i] _· ∆ξ[k]_ = 2ξi ∆ξ[i],

and equation (47) then leads to the following result. If for the

The first component ∗F will be called “direction curvature”; it

The perpendicularity of ∗∆x to x is expressed by the formula

_∗Fβik[α]_ _[ξ][α][ξ][β][ dx][i]_ _[δx][k]_ [=][ ∗][F][αβik][ξ][α][ξ][β][ dx][i] _[δx][k]_ [= 0][.]

The system of numbers ∗Fαβik is skew-symmetrical not only with
respect to i and k but also with respect to the index pair α and β.
In consequence we have also, in particular,

_∗Fαik[α]_ [= 0][.]

**Corollaries.—If the co-ordinate system and calibration**
around a point P is chosen so that they are geodetic at P, then
we have, at P, φi = 0, Γ[r]ik [= 0][, or, according to][ (48)][ and][ (49)][, the]
equivalent

_∂gik_
_φi = 0,_ = 0.

_∂xr_

The linear form dφ vanishes at P and the co-efficients of the
quadratic groundform become stationary; in other words, those
conditions come about at P, which are obtained in Euclidean
space simultaneously for all points by a single system of reference.
This results in the following explicit definition of the parallel dis

at P vanish relatively to it and the gik’s assume stationary values.
A vector is displaced from P parallel to itself to the infinitely near
point P _[′]_ by leaving its components in a system of reference be**longing to P unaltered. (There are always geodetic systems of**
reference; the choice of them does not affect the conception of
parallel displacements.)

Since, in a translation xi = xi(s), the velocity vector ui = _[dx][i]_

_ds_
moves so that it remains parallel to itself, it satisfies

_d(uiu[i])_

+ (uiu[i])(φiu[i]) = 0 in metrical geometry. (52)
_ds_

If at a certain moment the u[i]’s have such values that uiu[i] = 0 (a
case that may occur if the quadratic groundform Q is indefinite),
then this equation persists throughout the whole translation: we
shall call the trajectory of such a translation a geodetic null**line. An easy calculation shows that the geodetic null-lines do**
not alter if the metric relationship of the manifold is changed in
any way, as long as the measure-determination is kept fixed at
every point.
**Tensor Calculus.—It is an essential characteristic of a tensor**
that its components depend only on the co-ordinate system and
not on the calibration. In a generalised sense we shall, however,
also call a linear form which depends on the co-ordinate system
and the calibration a tensor, if it is transformed in the usual way
when the co-ordinate system is changed, but becomes multiplied
by the factor λ[e] (where λ = the calibration ratio) when the calibration is changed; we say that it is of weight e. Thus the gik’s are

weight being specified, we shall take this to mean that those of
weight 0 are being considered. The relations which were discussed
in tensor analysis are relations, which are independent of calibration and co-ordinate system, between tensors and tensor-densities
**in this special sense. We regard the extended conception of a**
tensor, and also the analogous one of tensor-density of weight e,
merely as an auxiliary conception, which is introduced to simplify calculations. They are convenient for two reasons: (1) They
make it possible to “juggle with indices” in this extended region.
By lowering a contra-variant index in the components of a tensor
of weight e we get the components of a tensor of weight e + 1,
the components being co-variant with respect to this index. The
process may also be carried out in the reverse direction. (2) Let
_g denote the determinant of the gik’s, furnished with a plus or_
minus sign according as the number g of the negative dimensions
is even or uneven, and let _[√]g be the positive root of this posi-_
tive number g. Then, by multiplying any tensor by _[√]g we_

**get a tensor-density whose weight is** _[n]_

**of the tensor; from a tensor of weight −[n]2** [we get, in partic-]

the evident fact that _[√]g is itself a scalar-density of weight_ _[n]_

We shall always indicate when a quantity is multiplied by _[√]g by_

by a tensor may also be represented by the tensor-density that is
derived from it by multiplying it by _[√]g, the difference between_
tensors and tensor-densities (as well as between co-variant and
contra-variant) is effaced. This makes it clear why for a long time
tensor-densities did not come into their right as compared with
tensors. The main use of tensor calculus in geometry is an inter**nal one, that is, to construct fields that are derived invariantly**
from the metrical structures. We shall give two examples that are
of importance for later work. Let the metrical manifold be (3+1)dimensional, so that −g will be the determinant of the gik’s. In
this space, as in every other, the distance curvature with components fik is a true linear tensor field of the second order. From it is
derived the contra-variant tensor f _[ik]_ of weight −2, which, on account of its weight differing from zero, is of no actual importance;
multiplication by _[√]g leads to f_ _[ik], a true linear tensor-density of_
the second order.

in metrical space—as, for example, the electromagnetic field—and
to set up the laws that hold in them. Now, we shall find at the
close of our investigations that this distinction between physics
and geometry is false, and that physics does not extend beyond
geometry. The world is a (3 + 1)-dimensional metrical manifold,
and all physical phenomena that occur in it are only modes of
expression of the metrical field. In particular, the affine relationship of the world is nothing more than the gravitational field, but
its metrical character is an expression of the state of the “æther”
that fills the world; even matter itself is reduced to this kind of
geometry and loses its character as a permanent substance. Clifford’s prediction, in an article of the Fortnightly Review of 1875,
becomes confirmed here with remarkable accuracy; in this he says
that “the theory of space curvature hints at a possibility of describing matter and motion in terms of extension only”.
These are, however, as yet dreams of the future. For the
present, we shall maintain our view that physical states are foreign
states in space. Now that the principles of infinitesimal geometry
have been worked out to their conclusion, we shall set out, in the
next paragraph, a number of observations about the special case
of Riemann’s space and shall give a number of formulæ which will
be of use later.

illustrate this application of the tensor calculus we shall here write
out the fundamental equations of the electrostatic and the magnetic field due to stationary currents in terms of general curvilinear
co-ordinates.
Firstly, let Ei be the components of the electric intensity of
field in a Cartesian co-ordinate system. By transforming the
quadratic and the linear differential forms

_ds[2]_ = dx[2]1 [+][ dx]2[2] [+][ dx]3[2] _E1 dx1 + E2 dx2 + E3 dx3_

respectively, into terms of arbitrary curvilinear co-ordinates (again
denoted by xi), each form being independent of the Cartesian coordinate system, suppose we get

_ds[2]_ = gik dxi dxk and _Ei dxi._

Then the Ei’s are in every co-ordinate system the components of
the same co-variant vector field. From them we form a vectordensity with components

**E[i]** = _[√]g · g[ik]Ek_ (g = |gik|).

We transform the potential −φ as a scalar into terms of the new
co-ordinates, but we define the density ρ of electricity as being the

of space; ρ is not then a scalar but a scalar density. The laws are

in which S, = EiE[i], are the components of a mixed tensor-density
of the second order, namely, the potential difference. The proof is
sufficiently indicated by the remark that these equations, in the
form we have written them, are absolutely invariant in character,
but pass into the fundamental equations, which were set up earlier,
for a Cartesian co-ordinate system.
The magnetic field produced by stationary currents was characterised in Cartesian co-ordinate systems by an invariant skewsymmetrical bilinear form Hik dxi δxk. By transforming the latter
into terms of arbitrary curvilinear co-ordinates, we get Hik, the
components of a linear tensor of the second order, namely, of the
_magnetic field, these components being co-variant with respect to_
arbitrary transformations of the co-ordinates. Similarly, we may
deduce the components φi of the vector potential as components
of a co-variant vector field in any curvilinear co-ordinate system.
We now introduce a linear tensor-density of the second order by
means of the equations

The s[i]’s are the components of a vector-density, the electric in_tensity of current; the potential differences S[k]i_ [have the same in-]
variant character as in the electric field. These formulæ may be
specialised for the case of, for example, spherical and cylindrical
co-ordinates. No further calculations are required to do this, if
we have an expression for ds[2], the distance between two adjacent
points, expressed in these co-ordinates; this expression is easily
obtained from considerations of infinitesimal geometry.
It is a matter of greater fundamental importance that (54) and
(55) furnish us with the underlying laws of stationary electromagnetic fields if unforeseen reasons should compel us to give up the
use of Euclidean geometry for physical space and replace it by
**Riemann’s geometry with a new groundform. For even in the**
case of such generalised geometric conditions our equations, in
virtue of their invariant character, represent statements that are
independent of all co-ordinate systems, and that express formal
relationships between charge, current, and field. In no wise can
it be doubted that they are the direct transcription of the laws
of the stationary electric field that hold in Euclidean space; it is
indeed astonishing how simply and naturally this transcription is

in a universally invariant form by differential equations of the second order in the gik’s (denoting the vanishing of the curvature)
but only the gik’s and their first derivatives appear in these laws.
It must be emphasised that a transcription of such a simple kind
is possible only for laws dealing with action at infinitesimal
**distances. To derive the laws of action at a distance correspond-**
ing to Coulomb’s, and Biot and Savart’s Law from these laws of
contiguous action is a purely mathematical problem that amounts
in essence to the following. In place of the usual potential equation ∆φ = 0 we get as its invariant generalisation (vide (54)) in
Riemann’s geometry the equation

co-efficients are, however, no longer constants. From this we are
to get the “standard solution,” tending to infinity, at any arbitrary

given point; this solution corresponds to the “standard solution” [1]

_r_
of the potential equation. It presents a difficult mathematical
problem that is treated in the theory of linear partial differential
equations of the second order. The same problem is presented
when we are limited to Euclidean space if, instead of investigating events in empty space, we have to consider those taking place
in a non-homogeneous medium (for example, in a medium whose
dielectric constant varies at different places with the time). Conditions are not so favourable for transcribing electromagnetic laws,

would be just as inadmissible to assume the possibility of a calibration that is independent of position in the case of currents and
charges as in the case of distances. Nothing is gained by pursuing
this idea. The true solution of the problem lies, as was indicated in
the concluding words of the previous paragraph, in quite another
direction.
Let us rather add a few observations about Riemann’s space
**as a special case. Let the unit measure (1 centimetre) be chosen**
once and for all; it must, of course, be the same at all points. The
metrical structure of the Riemann space is then described by an
invariant quadratic differential form gik dxi dxk or, what amounts
to the same thing, by a co-variant symmetrical tensor field of
the second order. The quantities φi, that are now equal to zero,
must be struck out everywhere in the formulæ of general metrical
geometry. Thus, the components of the affine relationship, which
here bear the name “Christoffel three-indices symbols” and are

For the total differential of a determinant with n[2] (independent and

of gik. If t[ik] (= t[ki]) is any symmetrical system of numbers, then we
always have
**t[ik]** _dgik = −tik dg[ik]._ (59)

_gijg[jk]_ = δi[k]

(for the “distance curvature” vanishes). It is easy to show that, from
them, it follows that (vide note 11)

_Rikαβ = Rαβik._

As the result of an observation on page 83, it follows that all those
conditions taken together enable us to characterise the curvature tensor completely by means of a quadratic form that is dependent on an
arbitrary element of surface, namely,

41 _[R][αβik][ ∆][x][αβ][ ∆][x][ik]_ (∆xik = dxi δxk − _dxk δxi)._

If this quadratic form is divided by the square of the magnitude of the
surface element, the quotient depends only on the ratio of the ∆xik’s,
i.e. on the position of the surface element; Riemann calls this number
the curvature of the space at the point P in the surface direction in
question. In two-dimensional Riemann space (on a surface) there is only
one surface direction and the tensor degenerates into a scalar (Gaussian
curvature). In Einstein’s theory of gravitation the contracted tensor of

Finally, by applying contraction once more we may form the scalar of
**curvature**
_R = g[ik]Rik._

In general metrical space the analogously formed scalar of curvature F
is expressed in the following way (as is easily shown) by the Riemann
expression R, which is dependent only on the gik’s and which has no
distinct meaning in that space:—

_∂([√]gφ[i])_
_F = R −_ (n − 1) _√[1]_ _−_ [(][n][ −] [1)(][n][ −] [2)] (φiφ[i]). (61)

_F is a scalar of weight −1. Hence, in a region in which F ̸= 0 we may_
define a unit of length by means of the equation F = constant. This
is a remarkable result inasmuch as it contradicts in a certain sense the
original view concerning the transference of lengths in general metrical
space, according to which a direct comparison of lengths at a distance
is not possible; it must be noticed, however, that the unit of length
which arises in this way is dependent on the conditions of curvature of
the manifold. (The existence of a unique uniform calibration of this
kind is no more extraordinary than the possibility of introducing into
Riemann’s space certain unique co-ordinate systems arising out of the
metrical structure.) The “volume” that is measured by using this unit
of length is represented by the invariant integral

If we use the length of arc itself as the parameter, Q becomes
equal to 1. Equation (65) states that a body in translation traverses its path, the geodetic line, with constant speed, namely,
that the time-parameter is proportional to s, the length of arc. In
Riemann’s space the geodetic line possesses not only the differential property of preserving its direction unaltered, but also the
**integral property that every portion of it is the shortest**
**line connecting its initial and its final point. This statement**
must not, however, be taken literally, but must be understood in
the same sense as the statement in mechanics that, in a position
of equilibrium, the potential energy is a minimum, or when it is
said of a function f (x, y) in two variables that it has a minimum
at points where its differential


_df =_ _[∂f]_ _[∂f]_

vanishes identically in dx and dy; whereas the true expression is
that it assumes a “stationary” value at that point, which may be a
minimum, a maximum, or a “point of inflexion”. The geodetic line
is not necessarily a curve of least length but is a curve of stationary
length. On the surface of a sphere, for instance, the great circles
are geodetic lines. If we take any two points, A and B, on such a
great circle, the shorter of the two arcs AB is indeed the shortest
line connecting A and B but the other arc AB is also a geodetic

Let any arbitrary curve be represented parametrically by

_xi = xi(s),_ (a ≤ _s ≤_ _b)._

We shall call it the “initial” curve. To compare it with neighbouring curves we consider an arbitrary family of curves involving one
parameter:
_xi = xi(s; ϵ),_ (a ≤ _s ≤_ _b)._

The parameter ϵ varies within an interval about ϵ = 0; xi(s; ϵ) are
to denote functions that resolve into xi(s) when ϵ = 0. Since all
curves of the family are to connect the same initial point with the
same final point, xi(a; ϵ) and xi(b; ϵ) are independent of ϵ. The
length of such a curve is given by

Further, we assume that s denotes the length of an arc of the initial

Although the author has aimed at lucidity of expression many
a reader will have viewed with abhorrence the flood of formulæ
and indices that encumber the fundamental ideas of infinitesimal
geometry. It is certainly regrettable that we have to enter into the
purely formal aspect in such detail and to give it so much space
but, nevertheless, it cannot be avoided. Just as anyone who wishes
to give expressions to his thoughts with ease must spend laborious
hours learning language and writing, so here too the only way that
we can lessen the burden of formulæ is to master the technique
of tensor analysis to such a degree that we can turn to the real
problems that concern us without feeling any encumbrance, our
object being to get an insight into the nature of space, time, and
matter so far as they participate in the structure of the external
world. Whoever sets out in quest of this goal must possess a
perfect mathematical equipment from the outset. Before we pass
on after these wearisome preparations and enter into the sphere
of physical knowledge along the route illumined by the genius
of Einstein, we shall seek to obtain a clearer and deeper vision
of metrical space. Our goal is to grasp the inner necessity and
uniqueness of its metrical structure as expressed in Pythagoras’
Law.

**§** **p**
**Theory of Groups**

Whereas the character of affine relationship presents no further
difficulties—the postulate on page 184 to which we subjected the
conception of parallel displacement, and which characterises it as
a kind of unaltered transference, defines its character uniquely—
we have not yet gained a view of metrical structure that takes us
beyond experience. It was long accepted as a fact that a metrical
character could be described by means of a quadratic differential
form, but this fact was not clearly understood. Riemann many
years ago pointed out that the metrical groundform might, with
equal right essentially, be a homogeneous function of the fourth
order in the differentials, or even a function built up in some other
way, and that it need not even depend rationally on the differentials. But we dare not stop even at this point. The underlying
general feature that determines the metrical structure at a point P
is the group of rotations. The metrical constitution of the manifold at the point P is known if, among the linear transformations
of the vector body (i.e. the totality of vectors), those are known
that are congruent transformations of themselves. There are just
as many different kinds of measure-determinations as there are
essentially different groups of linear transformations (whereby essentially different groups are such as are distinguished not merely
by the choice of co-ordinate system). In the case of Pythagorean
**metrical space, which we have alone investigated hitherto, the**
group of rotations consists of all linear transformations that convert the quadratic groundform into itself. But the group of rotations need not have an invariant at all in itself (that is, a function
hi h i d d i l bi d hi h i


-----

y )
Let us reflect upon the natural requirements that may be imposed on the conception of rotation. At a single point, as long
as the manifold has not yet a measure-determination, only the
_n-dimensional parallelepipeds can be compared with one another_
in respect to size. If ai (i = 1, 2, . . ., n) are arbitrary vectors that
are defined in terms of the initial unit vectors ei according to the
equations
**ai = αi[k][e][k]**

then the determinant of the αi[k][’s which, following Grassmann, we]
may conveniently denote by

[a1, a2, . . ., an]

[e1, e2, . . ., en]

is, according to definition, the volume of the parallelopiped
mapped out by the n vectors ai. If we choose another system of
unit vectors ¯ei all the volumes become multiplied by a common
constant factor, as we see from the “multiplication theorem of
determinants,” namely

[a1, a2, . . ., an] [¯e1, ¯e2, . . ., ¯en]

[[][a][1][,][ a][2][, . . .,][ a][n][]]

[e1, e2, . . ., en] [=] [¯e1, ¯e2, . . ., ¯en] [e1, e2, . . ., en][.]


The volumes are thus determined uniquely and independently of
the co-ordinate system once the unit measure has been chosen.
_Since a rotation is “not to alter” the vector body, it must obvi-_
_ously be a transformation that leaves the infinitesimal elements of_
_volume unaffected. Let the rotation that transforms the vector_
**x = (ξ[i]) into ¯x = (ξ[¯][i]) be represented by the equations**


-----

( _k[)]_ q
to 1. This being the postulate that applies to a single rotation,
we must demand of the rotations as a whole that they form a
**group in the sense of the definition given on page 13. Moreover,**
this group has to be a continuous one, that is the rotations are
to be elements of a one-dimensional continuous manifold.
If a linear vector transformation be given by its matrix A =
(αk[i] [)][ in passing from one co-ordinate system][ (][e][i][)][ to another][ (¯][e][i][)]
according to the equations

_U : ¯ei = u[k]i_ **[e][k][,]** (67)

then A becomes changed into UAU _[−][1]_ (where U _[−][1]_ denotes the
inverse of U ; UU _[−][1]_ and U _[−][1]U are equal to identity E). Hence_
every group that is derived from a given matrix group G by applying the operation UGU _[−][1]_ on every matrix G of G (U being the
same for all G’s) may be transformed into the given matrix group
by an appropriate change of co-ordinate system. Such a group
_U_ **GU** _[−][1]_ will be said to be of the same kind as G (or to differ
from G only in orientation). If G is the group of rotation matrices at P and if U **GU** _[−][1]_ is identical with G (this does not mean
that G must again pass into G as a result of the operation UGU _[−][1],_
but all that is required is that G and UGU _[−][1]_ belong to G simultaneously) then the expressions for the metrical structures of two
co-ordinate systems (67), that are transformed into one another
by U, are similar; U is a representation of the vector body on
itself, such that it leaves all the metrical relations unaltered. This
is the conception of similar representation. G is included in
the group G[∗] of similar representations as a sub-group.
From the metrical structure at a single point we now pass on


-----

p 0 g g
representation at P0 = x[0]i [of the vector body on itself at an in-]
finitely near point P = (x[0]i [+][ dx][i][)][ is a][ congruent transference][.]
Together with A every representation (or transformation) AG0, in
which A is followed by a rotation G0 at P0, is likewise a congruent transference; thus, from one congruent transference A of the
vector body from P0 to P, we get all possible ones by making G0
traverse the group of rotations belonging to P0. If we consider the
vector body belonging to the centre P0 for two positions congruent
to one another, they will resolve into two congruent positions at P
if subjected to the same congruent transference A; for this reason,
the group of rotations G at P is equal to AG0A[−][1]. The metrical
relationship thus tells us that the group of rotations at P differs
from that at P0 only in orientation. If we pass continuously from
the point P0 to any point of the manifold, we see that the groups
of rotation are of a similar kind at all points of the manifold; thus
there is homogeneity in this respect.
The only congruent transferences that we take into consideration are those in which the vector components ξ[i] undergo
changes dξ[i] that are infinitesimal and of the same order as the
displacement of the centre P0,

_dξ[i]_ = dλ[i]k _[·][ ξ][k][.]_

If L and M are two such transferences from P0 to P, with coefficients dλ[i]k [and][ dµ]k[i] [respectively, then the rotation][ ML][−][1][ is]
likewise infinitesimal: it is represented by the formula

_dξ[i]_ = dαk[i] _[·][ ξ][k]_ where _dαk[i]_ [=][ dµ]k[i] _[−]_ _[dλ]k[i]_ _[.]_ (68)

The following will also be true If an infinitesimal congruent


-----

y p y ( _i[)][,]_
we get a congruent transference that is effected by the resultant
displacement dxi + δxi of the centre (plus an error which is infinitesimal compared with the magnitude of the displacements).
Hence, if for the transition from P0 = (x[0]1[, x][0]2[, . . ., x]n[0] [)][ to the point]
(x[0]1 [+][ ϵ, x]2[0][, . . ., x]n[0] [)][, this being an infinitesimal change][ ϵ][ in the]
direction of the first co-ordinate axis,

_dξ[i]_ = ϵ · Λ[i]k[ξ][k]

is a congruent transference, and if Λ[i]k2[, . . .,][ Λ]kn[i] [have a correspond-]
ing meaning for the displacements of P0 in the direction of the 2nd
up to the nth co-ordinate in turn; then the equation

_dξ[i]_ = Λ[i]kr _[dx][r]_ _[·][ ξ][k]_ (69)

gives a congruent transference for an arbitrary displacement having components dxi.
Among the various kinds of metrical spaces we shall now designate by simple intrinsic relations the category to which, according to Pythagoras’ and Riemann’s ideas, real space belongs. The
group of rotations that does not vary with position exhibits a
property that belongs to space as a form of phenomena; it characterises the metrical nature of space. The metrical relationship,[∗]

from point to point, however, is not determined by the nature of
space, nor by the mutual orientation of the groups of rotation at
the various points of the manifold. The metrical relationship is
dependent rather on the disposition of the material content, and
is thus in itself free and capable of any “virtual” changes. We shall
formulate the fact that it is subject to no limitation as our first
axiom


-----

**p** **p**
**Metrical Relationship**

It is possible to find a metrical relationship in space between
the point P0 and the points in its neighbourhood such that the
formula (69) represents a system of congruent transferences to
these neighbouring points for arbitrarily given numbers Λ[i]kr[.]
Corresponding to every co-ordinate system xi at P0 there is a
possible conception of parallel displacement, namely, the displacement of the vectors from P0 to the infinitely near points without
the components undergoing a change in this co-ordinate system.
Such a system of parallel displacements of the vector body from P0
to all the infinitely near points is expressed, as we know, in terms
of a definite co-ordinate system, selected once and for all by the
formula
_dξ[i]_ = −dγ[i] _· ξ[k]_

in which the differential forms dγk[i] [=][ Γ]kr[i] _[dx][r][ satisfy the condition]_
of symmetry
Γ[i]kr [=][ Γ]rk[i] _[.]_ (70)

And, indeed, a possible conception of parallel displacement corresponds to every system of symmetrical co-efficients Γ. For a given
metrical relationship the further restriction that the “parallel displacements” shall simultaneously be congruent transferences must
be imposed. The second postulate is the one enunciated above as
the fundamental theorem of infinitesimal geometry; for a given
metrical relationship there is always a single system of parallel
displacements among the transferences of the vector body. We

cluded from congruent transferences, and that the conception of
parallel displacement is determined by the metrical relationship.
This postulate may be enunciated thus:—

**II. The Affine Relationship is Uniquely Determined by**
**the Metrical Relationship**

Before we can formulate it analytically we must deal with infinitesimal rotations. A continuous group G of r members is a
continuous r-dimensional manifold of matrices. If s1, s2, . . ., sr are
co-ordinates in this manifold, then, corresponding to every value
system of the co-ordinates there is a matrix A(s1, s2, . . ., sr) of the
group which depends on the value-system continuously. There is
a definite value-system—we may assume for it that s1 = 0—to
which identity, E, corresponds. The matrices of the group that
are infinitely near E differ from E by

A1 ds1 + A2 ds2 + . . . + Ar dsr,

in which Ai = . We call a matrix A an infinitesimal op

eration of the group if the group contains a transformation (independent of ϵ) that coincides with E and ϵA to within an error
that converges more rapidly towards zero than ϵ, for decreasing
small values of ϵ. The infinitesimal operations of the group form
the linear family

**g : λ1A1 + λ2A2 + · · · + λrAr** (λ being arbitrary numbers) (71)

**g is exactly r dimensional and the A’s are linearly independent**


-----

g p p p y p g p
are infinitely near A in the formula A(E + ϵA), in which ϵ is an
infinitesimal factor and A traverses the group g. If g were of less
dimensions than r, the same would hold at each point of the manifold; for all values of si there would be linear relations between

the derivatives _[∂A]_, and A would in reality depend on less than r

_∂si_

parameters. The infinitesimal operations generate and determine
the whole group. If we carry out the infinitesimal transformation

_E +_ [1]

_n[A][ (][n][ being an infinitely great number)][ n][-times successively,]_

we get a matrix (of the group) that is finite and different from E,
namely,


_A = lim_
_n→∞_


�E + [1] �n = E + [A] [A][2] [A][3]

_n[A]_ 1! [+] 2! [+] 3! [+][ . . .][ ;]


and thus we get every matrix of the group (or at least every one
that may be reached continuously in the group, by starting from
identity) if we make A traverse the whole family g. Not every
arbitrarily given linear family(71) gives a group in this way, but
only those in which the A’s satisfy a certain condition of integrability. The latter is obtained by a method quite analogous to
that by which, for example, the condition of integrability is obtained for parallel displacement in Euclidean space. If we pass
from Identity, E(si = 0), by an infinitesimal change dsi of the
parameters, to the neighbouring matrix Ad = E + _dA, and thence_
by a second infinitesimal change δsi, from Aδ to AδAd and then
reverse these two operations whilst preserving the same order, we
get A[−]δ [1][A]d[−][1][A][δ][A][d][, a matrix (of the group) differing by an infinitely]
small amount from E Let d be the change in the direction of the

_As = A(s, 0, 0, . . ., 0)_ and _At = A(0, t, 0, . . ., 0)._

Now, As0 = A0t = E, hence


_Ast −_ _E_ � _∂2Ast_

Since Ast belongs to the group, this limit is an infinitesimal operation of the group. We find, however, that

_∂t_


leading to

_∂[2]Ast_

_∂s ∂t_ [=][ −][A][1][A][2][ +][ A][2][A][1]

Accordingly A1A2 − A2A1, or, more generally, AiAk − AkAi must
be an infinitesimal operation of the group: or, what amounts
to the same thing, if A and B are two infinitesimal operations
of the group, then AB − BA must also always be one. Sophus
Lie, to whom we are indebted for the fundamental conceptions
and facts of the theory of continuous transformation groups
(vide note 12), has shown that this condition of integrability
is not only necessary but also sufficient Hence we may define


-----

_g_ _p_ _g_ _f,_ _y_
_belong to the family, AB −_ BA also belongs to the family. By
introducing the infinitesimal operations of the group, the problem
of continuous transformation groups becomes a linear question.
If all the transformations of the group leave the elements of
volume unaltered, the “traces” of the infinitesimal operations =
0. For the development of the determinant of E + ϵA in powers
of ϵ begins with the members 1 + ϵ · trace(A). _U is a similar_
transformation, if, for every G of the group of rotations, UGU _[−][1]_

or, what comes to the same thing, UGU _[−][1]G[−][1], belongs to the_
group of rotations G. Accordingly, A[∗]0 [is an infinitesimal operation]
of the group of similar transformations if, and only if, A[∗]0[A][ −] [AA][∗]0
also belongs to g, no matter which of the matrices A of the group
of infinitesimal rotations is used.
The infinitesimal Euclidean rotations

_dξ[i]_ = vk[i] _[ξ][k][,]_

that is, the infinitesimal linear transformations that leave the unit
quadratic form

_Q0 = (ξ[1])[2]_ + (ξ[2])[2] + · · · + (ξ[n])[2]

invariant, were determined on page 69. The condition which characterises them, namely,

12 _[dQ][0][ =][ ξ][i][ dξ][i][ = 0][,]_ implies that _vi[k]_ [=][ −][v]k[i] _[.]_

Thus it is seen that we are dealing with the infinitesimal group δ

of all skew-symmetrical matrices; it obviously has _[n][(][n][ −]_ [1)] mem

-----

p g p p p y _Q_ y q
that remains invariant during the infinitesimal Euclidean rotations, i.e. dQ = 0, then Q necessarily coincides with Q0 except for
a constant factor. Indeed, if

_Q = aikξ[i]ξ[k]_ (aki = aik)

then for all skew-symmetrical number systems vk[i] [the equation]

_arkvi[k]_ [+][ a][ri][v]k[r] [= 0] (72)

must hold. If we assume k = i and notice that the numbers
_vi[1][, v]i[2][, . . ., v]i[n]_ [may be chosen arbitrarily for each particular][ i][, ex-]
cepting the case vi[i] [= 0][, we get][ a][ri] [= 0][ for][ r][ ̸][=][ i][. If we write][ a][ii]
for ai, equation (72) becomes

_vi[k][(][a][i]_ _[−]_ _[a][k][) = 0]_

from which we immediately deduce that all ai’s are equal. The
corresponding group δ[∗] of similar transformations is derived from δ
by “associating” the single matrix E; this here signifies dξ[i] = ϵξ[i].
For if the matrix C = (c[k]i [)][ belongs to][ δ][∗][, that is, if for every skew-]
symmetrical vi[k][,][ c]r[i] _[v]k[r]_ _[−]_ _[v]r[i]_ _[c][r]k_ [is also a skew-symmetrical number]
system, then the quantities c[i]k [+][ c]i[k] [=][ a][ik] [satisfy equation][ (72)][;]
whence it follows that aik = 2a · δi[k][; that is,][ C][ is equal to][ aE][ plus]
a skew-symmetrical matrix.
More generally, let δQ denote the infinitesimal group of linear transformations that transform an arbitrary non-degenerate
quadratic form Q into itself. δQ and δQ′ are distinguished only by
their orientation, if Q[′] is generated from Q by a linear transfor

tial index attached to the form Q. But even these differences are
eliminated if, instead of confining ourselves to the realm of real
quantities, we use that of complex members; in that case, every δQ
is of the same type as δ.
These preliminary remarks enable us to formulate analytically
the two postulates I and II. Let g be the group of infinitesimal
rotations at P . We take Λ[i]kr [to denote every system of][ n][3][ num-]
bers, A[i]kr [to denote every system that is composed of matrices]
(A[i]k1[)][,][ (][A]k[i] 2[)][, . . .,][ (][A]kn[i] [)][ belonging to][ g][ and][ Γ]kr[i] [to denote an ar-]
bitrary system of numbers that satisfies the condition of symmetry (70). If the group of infinitesimal rotations has N members, these member systems form linear manifolds of n[3], nN and

_n ·_ _[n][(][n][ + 1)]_ dimensions respectively. Since, according to I, if

the metrical relationship runs through all possible values, any
arbitrary number systems Λ[i]k1[,][ Λ]k[i] 2[, . . .,][ Λ]kn[i] [may occur as the co-]
efficients of n infinitesimal congruent transferences in the n coordinate directions (cf. (69)), then, by II (cf. (68)) each Λ must
be capable of resolution in one and only one way according to the
formula
Λ[i]kr [=][ A]kr[i] _[−]_ [Γ]kr[i] _[.]_

This entails two results

1. _n[3]_ = nN + n · _[n][(][n][ + 1)]_ or _N =_ _[n][(][n][ −]_ [1)];

2. A[i]kr _[−]_ [Γ]kr[i] [is never equal to zero, unless all the][ A][’s and][ Γ][’s]
vanish; or, a non-vanishing system A can never fulfil the condition
of symmetry, A[i]kr [=][ A]rk[i] [.] To enable us to formulate this condition invariantly let us define a symmetrical double matrix (an


-----

y
_ζ_ _[i]_ = A[i]rs[ξ][r][η][s] (A[i]rs [=][ A]sr[i] [)][,]

which produces from two arbitrary vectors, ξ and η, a vector ζ as a
bilinear symmetrical form, provided that for every fixed vector η,
the transition ξ → _ζ (and hence also for every fixed vector ξ the_
transition η → _ζ) is an operation of g. We may then summarise_
our results thus:—
_The group of infinitesimal rotations has the following proper-_
_ties according to our axioms:_
(a) The trace of every matrix = 0;
(b) No symmetrical double matrix belongs to g except zero;
(c) The dimensional number of g is the highest that is still in

_agreement with postulate (b), namely, N =_ _[n][(][n][ −]_ [1)].

2
These properties retain their meaning for complex quantities
as well as for real ones. We shall just verify that they are true
of the infinitesimal Euclidean group of rotations δ, that is, that
_n[3]_ numbers vkl[i] [cannot simultaneously satisfy the conditions of]
symmetry
_vlk[i]_ [=][ v]kl[i] _[,]_ _vil[k]_ [=][ −][v]kl[i] _[,]_

without all of them vanishing. This is evident from the calculation which was undertaken on page 184 to determine the affine
relationship. For if we write down the three equations that we get
from vkl[i] [+] _[v]il[k]_ [= 0][ by interchanging the indices][ i, k, l][ cyclically, and]
then subtract the second from the sum of the first and the third,
we get, as a result of the first condition of symmetry, vkl[i] [= 0][.]
It seems highly probable to the author that δ is the only infinitesimal group that satisfies the postulates (a), (b), and (c);
or more exactly in the case of complex quantities every such in


-----

pp p y, g p
infinitesimal rotations must be identical with a certain group δQ,
in which Q is a non-degenerate quadratic form. Q itself is determined by g except for a constant of proportionality. It is real if
**g is real. For if we split Q (in which the variables are taken as**
real) into a real and an imaginary part Q1 + iQ2, then g leaves
both these forms Q1 and Q2 invariant. Hence we must have

_Q1 = c1Q_ _Q2 = c2Q._

One of these two constants is certainly different from zero, since
_c1 +_ _ic2 = 1, and hence Q must be a real form excepting for a con-_
stant factor. This would link up with the line of argument followed
in the preceding paragraph and would complete the Analysis of
Space; we should then be able to claim to have made intelligible
the nature of space and the source of the validity of Pythagoras’
Theorem, by having explored the ultimate grounds accessible to
mathematical reasoning (vide note 13). If the supposed mathematical proposition is not true, definite characteristics and essentials of space will yet have escaped us. The author has proved that
the proposition holds actually for the lowest dimensional numbers
_n = 2 and n = 3. It would lead too far to present these purely_
mathematical considerations here.
In conclusion, it will be advisable to call attention to two
points. Firstly, axiom I is in no wise contradicted by the result of axiom II which states that not only the metrical structure,
but also the metrical relationship is of the same kind at every
point, namely, of the simplest type imaginable. For every point
there is a geodetic co-ordinate system such that the shifting of
all vectors at that point which leaves its components unaltered

metrical structure of Pythagorean space in the way here outlined
depends solely on the circumstance that the quantitative metrical
conditions admit of considerable virtual changes. This possibility
stands or falls with the dynamical view of Riemann. It is this
view, the truth of which can scarcely be doubted after the success
that has attended Einstein’s Theory of Gravitation (Chapter IV),
that opens up the road leading to the discovery of the “Rationality
of Space”.
The investigations about space that have been conducted in
Chapter II seemed to the author to offer a good example of the
kind of analysis of the modes of existence (Wesensanalyse) which
is the object of Husserl’s phenomenological philosophy, an example that is typical of cases in which we are concerned with nonimmanent modes. The historical development of the problem of
space teaches how difficult it is for us human beings entangled
in external reality to reach a definite conclusion. A prolonged
phase of mathematical development, the great expansion of geometry dating from Euclid to Riemann, the discovery of the physical
facts of nature and their underlying laws from the time of Galilei,
together with the incessant impulses imparted by new empirical data, finally the genius of individual great minds—Newton,
Gauss, Riemann, Einstein—all these factors were necessary to set
us free from the external, accidental, non-essential characteristics which would otherwise have held us captive. Certainly, once
the true point of view has been adopted reason becomes flooded
with light, and it recognises and appreciates what is of itself intelligible to it. Nevertheless, although reason was, so to speak,
always conscious of this point of view in the whole development

philosophers who believe it possible to describe adequately the
mode of existence on the basis of a single act of typical presentation (exemplarischer Vergegenwärtigung): in principle they are
right: yet from the point of view of human nature, how utterly
they are wrong! The problem of space is at the same time a very
instructive example of that question of phenomenology that seems
to the author to be of greatest consequence, namely, in how far
the delimitation of the essentialities perceptible in consciousness
expresses the structure peculiar to the realm of presented objects,
and in how far mere convention participates in this delimitation.

RELATIVITY OF SPACE AND TIME

**§ 19. Galilei’s Principle of Relativity**

We have already discussed in the introduction how it is possible to measure time by means of a clock and how, after an arbitrary initial point of time and a time-unit has been chosen, it is
possible to characterise every point of time by a number t. But
the union of space and time gives rise to difficult further problems that are treated in the theory of relativity. The solution of
these problems, which is one of the greatest feats in the history
of the human intellect, is associated above all with the names of
**Copernicus and Einstein (vide note 1).**
By means of a clock we fix directly the time-conditions of only
such events as occur just at the locality at which the clock happens to be situated. Inasmuch as I, as an unenlightened being,
fix, without hesitation, the things that I see into the moment of
their perception, I extend my time over the whole world. I believe
that there is an objective meaning in saying of an event which is
happening somewhere that it is happening “now” (at the moment
at which I pronounce the word!); and that there is an objective
meaning in asking which of two events that have happened at
different places has occurred earlier or later than the other. We
**shall for the present accept the point of view implied**
**in these assumptions. Every space-time event that is strictly**
localised, such as the flash of a spark that is instantaneously extinguished, occurs at a definite space-time-point or world-point,
“here-now”. As a result of the point of view enunciated above, to

event in space. For example, we ascribe to two point-masses a distance separating them at a definite moment. We assume that the
world-points corresponding to a definite moment t form a threedimensional point-manifold for which Euclidean geometry holds.
(In the present chapter we adopt the view of space set forth in
Chapter I.) We choose a definite unit of length and a rectangular co-ordinate system at the moment t (such as the corner of a
room). Every world-point whose time-co-ordinate is t then has
three definite space-co-ordinates x1, x2, x3.
Let us now fix our attention on another moment t[′]. We assume
that there is a definite objective meaning in stating that measurements are carried out at the moment t[′] with the same unit length
as that used at the moment t (by means of a “rigid” measuring
staff that exists both at the time t and at the time t[′]). In addition to the unit of time we shall adopt a unit of length fixed
once and for all (centimetre, second). We are then still free to
choose the position of the Cartesian co-ordinate system independently of the choice of time t. Only when we believe that there
is objective meaning in stating that two point-events happening
at arbitrary moments take place at the same point of space, and
in saying that a body is at rest, are we able to fix the position
of the co-ordinate system for all times on the basis of the position chosen arbitrarily at a certain moment, without having to
specify additional “individual objects”; that is, we accept the postulate that the co-ordinate system remains permanently at rest.
After choosing an initial point in the time-scale and a definite coordinate system at this initial moment we then get four definite
co-ordinates for every world-point. To be able to represent con

space to be only two-dimensional, a Euclidean plane.
We construct a graphical picture by representing in a space
carrying the rectangular set of axes (x1, x2, t) the world-point by
a “picture”-point with co-ordinates (x1, x2, t). We can then trace
out graphically the “time-table” of all moving point-masses; the
motion of each is represented by a “world-line,” whose direction
has always a positive component in the direction of the t-axis.
The world-lines of point-masses that are at rest are parallels to
the t-axis. The world-line of a point-mass which is in uniform
translation is a straight line. On a section t = constant we may
read off the position of all the point-masses at the same time t. If
we choose an initial point in the time-scale and also some other
Cartesian co-ordinate system, and if (x1, x2, t), (x[′]1[, x][′]2[, t][′][)][ are the]
co-ordinates of an arbitrary world-point in the first and second

hold; in them, the αi’s and the a denote constants, the αik’s, in
particular, are the co-efficients of an orthogonal transformation.
The world-co-ordinates are thus fixed except for an arbitrary
**transformation of this kind in an objective manner without**
individual objects or events being specified. In this we have not
yet taken into consideration the arbitrary choice of both units of
measure. If the initial point remains unchanged both in space
and in time, so that α1 = α2 = a = 0, then (x[′]1[, x][′]2[, t][′][)][ are the co-]
ordinates with respect to a rectilinear system of axes whose t[′] axis
coincides with the t-axis, whereas the axes x[′]1[,][ x][′]2 [are derived from]
_x1, x2 by a rotation in their plane t = 0._
A moment’s reflection suffices to show that one of the assumptions adopted is not true, namely, the one which states that the

meet some one at the same place to-morrow as that at which we

All this acquires meaning as a result of the fortunate circumstance that at birth we are introduced into an essentially stable

ships travel at so and so many knots: these things are always understood in ordinary life as referring to the firm ground on which
we stand. Only the motions of bodies (point-masses) rel**ative to one another have an objective meaning, that is,**
the distances and angles that are determined from simultaneous
positions of the point-masses and their functional relation to the

surfaces of the first family are again planes that coincide with the
planes t = const.; on the other hand, the other two families of
surfaces are curved surfaces. The transformation formulæ are no
longer linear.
Under these circumstances we achieve an important aim, when
investigating the motion of systems of point-masses, such as planets, by choosing the co-ordinate system so that the functions

orated to such an extraordinary degree by Kepler, namely, that
there is in fact a co-ordinate system for which the laws of planetary
motion assume a much simpler and more expressive form than if
they are referred to a motionless earth. The work of Copernicus
produced a revolution in the philosophic ideas about the world
inasmuch as he shattered the belief in the absolute impor**tance of the earth. His reflections as well as those of Kepler are**
purely kinematical in character. Newton crowned their work by
discovering the true ground of the kinematical laws of Kepler to lie
in the fundamental dynamical law of mechanics and in the law
of attraction. Every one knows how brilliantly the mechanics of
Newton has been confirmed both for celestial as well as for earthly
phenomena. As we are convinced that it is valid universally and
not only for planetary systems, and as its laws are by no means
invariant with respect to the transformations (II), it enables us to
fix the co-ordinate system in a manner independent of all individual specification and much more definitely than is possible on the
kinematical view to which the principle of relativity (II) leads.
**Galilei’s Principle of Inertia (Newton’s First Law of Mo-**
tion) forms the foundation of mechanics. It states that a pointmass which is subject to no forces from without executes a uniform
translation. Its world-line is consequently a straight line, and the
space-co-ordinates x1, x2 of the point-mass are linear functions of
the time t. If this principle holds for the two co-ordinate systems
connected by (II), then x1 and x2 must become linear functions
of t[′], when linear functions of t[′] are substituted for x[′]1 [and][ x]2[′] [.]
It straightway follows from this that the αik’s must be constants,
and that α1 and α2 must be linear functions of t; that is, the one

versely, it is easily shown that if C1, C2 are two such co-ordinate
systems, then if the principle of inertia and Newtonian mechanics
holds for C it will also hold for C[′]. Thus, in mechanics, any two
“allowable” co-ordinate systems are connected by formulæ

in which the αik’s are constant co-efficients of an orthogonal transformation, and a, αi and γi are arbitrary constants. Every transformation of this kind represents a transition from one allowable
co-ordinate system to another. (This is the Principle of Rel**ativity of Galilei and Newton.) The essential feature of this**
transition is that, if we disregard the naturally arbitrary directions of the axis in space and the arbitrary initial point, there is
invariance with respect to the transformations

_x1 = x[′]1_ [+][ γ][1][t][′][,] _x2 = x[′]2_ [+][ γ][2][t][′][,] _t = t[′]._ (1)

In our graphical representation (vide Fig. 7) x[′]1[,][ x][′]2[,][ t][′][ would be the]
co-ordinates taken with respect to a rectilinear set of axes in which
the x[′]1[-,][ x][′]2[-axes coincide with the][ x][1][-,][ x][2][-axes, whereas the new]
_t[′]-axis has some new direction. The following considerations show_
that the laws of Newtonian mechanics are not altered in passing
from one co-ordinate system C to another C[′]. According to the
law of attraction the gravitational force with which one point-mass
acts on another at a certain moment is a vector, in space, which is
independent of the co ordinate system (as is also the vector that

Newtonian mechanics, which demands a physics that satisfies this
assumption in order to be able to give a content to its conception of
force. We may prove, for example, in the theory of elasticity that
the stresses (as a consequence of their relationship to deformation
quantities) are of the required kind.
Mass is a scalar that is independent of the co-ordinate system. Finally, on account of the transformation formulæ that result
from (1) for the motion of a point-mass,

not the velocity, but the acceleration is a vector (in space) independent of the co-ordinate system. Accordingly, the fundamental
law: mass times acceleration = force, has the required invariant property.
According to Newtonian mechanics the centre of inertia of every isolated mass-system not subject to external forces moves in
a straight line. If we regard the sun and his planets as such a system, there is no meaning in asking whether the centre of inertia of
the solar system is at rest or is moving with uniform translation.
The fact that astronomers, nevertheless, assert that the sun is
moving towards a point in the constellation of Hercules, is based
on the statistical observation that the stars in that region seem
on the average to diverge from a certain centre—just as a cluster
of trees appears to diverge as we approach them. If it is certain
that the stars are on the average at rest, that is, that the centre
of inertia of the stellar firmament is at rest the statement about

To grasp the true meaning of the principle of relativity, one
must get accustomed to thinking not in “space,” nor in “time,” but
“in the world,” that is in space-time. Only the coincidence (or
the immediate succession) of two events in space-time has a meaning that is directly evident, it is just the fact that in these cases
space and time cannot be dissociated from one another absolutely
that is asserted by the principle of relativity. Following the mechanistic view, according to which all physical happening can be
traced back to mechanics, we shall assume that not only mechanics but the whole of the physical uniformity of Nature is subject to
the principle of relativity laid down by Galilei and Newton, which
states that it is impossible to single out from the systems of refer_ence that are equivalent for mechanics and of which each two are_
_correlated by the formula of transformation (III) special systems_
_without specifying individual objects. These formulæ condition_
**the geometry of the four-dimensional world in exactly the**
same way as the group of transformation substitutions connecting
two Cartesian co-ordinate systems condition the Euclidean geometry of three-dimensional space. A relation between world-points
has an objective meaning if, and only if, it is defined by such
arithmetical relations between the co-ordinates of the points as
are invariant with respect to the transformations (III). Space is
said to be homogeneous at all points and homogeneous in all directions at every point. These assertions are, however, only parts
of the complete statement of homogeneity that all Cartesian
co-ordinate systems are equivalent. In the same way the principle of relativity determines exactly the sense in which the world

It is indeed remarkable that two mechanical events that are
fully alike kinematically, may be different dynamically, as a comparison of the dynamical principle of relativity (III) with the much
more general kinematical principle of relativity (II) teaches us. A
rotating spherical mass of fluid existing all alone, or a rotating flywheel, cannot in itself be distinguished from a spherical fluid mass
or a fly-wheel at rest; in spite of this the “rotating” sphere becomes
flattened, whereas the one at rest does not change its shape, and
stresses are called up in the rotating fly-wheel that cause it to
burst asunder, if the rate of rotation be sufficiently great, whereas
no such effect occurs in the case of a fly-wheel which is at rest.
The cause of this varying behaviour can be found only in the “metrical structure of the world,” that reveals itself in the centrifugal
forces as an active agent. This sheds light on the idea quoted from
Riemann above; if there corresponds to metrical structure (in this
case that of the world and not the fundamental metrical tensor
of space) something just as real, which acts on matter by means
of forces, as the something which corresponds to Maxwell’s stress
tensor, then we must assume that, conversely, matter also reacts
on this real something. We shall revert to this idea again later in
Chapter IV.
For the present we shall call attention only to the linear character of the transformation formulæ (III); this signifies that the
**world is a four-dimensional affine space. To give a system-**
atic account of its geometry we accordingly use world-vectors
or displacements in addition to world-points. A displacement of
the world is a transformation that assigns to every world-point P
a world-point P _[′], and is characterised by being expressible in an_


-----

_x[′]i_ [=][ x][i] [+][ α][i] (i = 0, 1, 2, 3)

in which the xi’s denote the four space-time-co-ordinates of P
(t being represented by x0), and the x[′]i[’s are those of][ P][ ′][ in this co-]
ordinate system, whereas the αi’s are constants. This conception
is independent of the allowable co-ordinate system selected. The
displacement that transforms P into P _[′]_ (or transfers P to P _[′])_
is denoted by _[−−→]PP_ _[′]. The world-points and displacements satisfy_
all the axioms of the affine geometry whose dimensional number
is n = 4. Galilei’s Principle of Inertia (Newton’s First Law of
Motion) is an affine law; it states what motions realise the straight
lines of our four-dimensional affine space (“world”), namely, those
executed by point-masses moving under no forces.
From the affine point of view we pass on to the metrical
one. From the graphical picture, which gave us an affine view
of the world (one co-ordinate being suppressed), we can read off
its essential metrical structure; this is quite different from that of
Euclidean space. The world is “stratified”; the planes, t = const.,
in it have an absolute meaning. After a unit of time has been chosen, each two world-points A and B have a definite time-difference,
the time-component of the vector _[−→]AB = x; as is generally the case_
with vector-components in an affine co-ordinate system, the timecomponent is a linear form t(x) of the arbitrary vector x. The
vector x points into the past or the future according as t(x) is
negative or positive. Of two world-points A and B, A is earlier
than, simultaneous with, or later than B, according as

on a definite quadratic form, which is in this case defined only
for those world-vectors x that lie in one and the same stratum,
that is, that satisfy the equation t(x) = 0 (for there is sense only
in speaking of the distance between simultaneous positions of
two point-masses). Whereas, then, the metrical structure of
Euclidean geometry is based on a definitely positive quadratic
form, that of Galilean geometry is based on
1. A linear form t(x) of the arbitrary vector x (the “duration”
of the displacement x).
2. A definitely positive quadratic form (x, x) (the square of
the “length” of x), which is defined only for the three-dimensional
_linear manifold of all the vectors x that satisfy the equation_
_t(x) = 0._
We cannot do without a definite space of reference, if we wish
to form a picture of physical conditions. Such a space depends
on the choice of an arbitrary displacement e in the world (within
which the time-axis falls in the picture), and is then defined by
the convention that all world-points that lie on a straight line of
direction e, meet at the same point of space. In geometrical
language, we are merely dealing with the process of parallel pro**jection. To arrive at an appropriate formulation we shall begin**
with some geometrical considerations that relate to an arbitrary
_n-dimensional affine space. To enable us to form a picture of the_
processes we shall confine ourselves to the case n = 3. Let us take
a family of straight lines in space all drawn parallel to the vector e
(̸= 0). If we look into space along these rays, all the space-points
that lie behind one another in the direction of such a straight line
would coincide; it is in no wise necessary to specify a plane on to


-----

g
Let e, a vector differing from 0, be given. If A and A[′] are
two points such that _[−−→]AA[′]_ is a multiple of e, we shall say that
they pass into one and the same point A of the minor space
defined by e. We may represent A by the straight line parallel
to e, on which all these coincident points A, A[′], . . . in the minor
space lie. Since every displacement x of the space transforms a
straight line parallel to e again into one parallel to e, x brings
about a definite displacement x of the minor space; but each two
displacements x and x[′] become coincident in the minor space, if
their difference is a multiple of e. We shall denote the transition to
the minor space, “the projection in the direction of e,” by printing
the symbols for points and displacements in heavy oblique type.
Projection converts

_λx, x + y, and_ _[−→]AB into λx, x + y,_ _[−→]AB_

that is, the projection has a true affine character; this means that
in the minor space affine geometry holds, of which the dimensions
are less by one than those of the original “complete” space.
If the space is metrical in the Euclidean sense, that is, if it
is based on a non-degenerate quadratic form which is its metrical
groundform, Q(x) = (x, x),—to simplify the picture of the process
we shall keep the case for which Q is definitely positive in view, but
the line of proof is applicable generally,—then we shall obviously
ascribe to the two points of the minor space, which two straight
lines parallel to e appear to be, when we look into the space in
the direction of e, a distance equal to the perpendicular distance
between the two straight lines. Let us formulate this analytically.

of which the first is proportional to e and the second is perpendicular to it, viz.:—

(x[∗], e) = 0, _ξ =_ [1] (3)

_e_ [(][x][,][ e][)][.]

We shall call ξ the height of the displacement x (it is the difference of height between A and B, if x = _[−→]AB). We have_

(x, x) = eξ[2] + (x[∗], x[∗]). (4)

**x is characterised fully, if its height ξ and the displacement x of**
the minor space produced by x are given; we write

**x = ξ | x.**

The “complete” space is “split up” into height and minor space,
the “position-difference” x of two points in the complete space
is split up into the difference of height ξ, and the difference of
position x in the minor space. There is a meaning not only in
saying that two points in space coincide, but also in saying that
two points in the minor space coincide or have the same height,
respectively. Every displacement x of the minor space is produced
by one and only one displacement x[∗] of the complete space,
this displacement being orthogonal to e. The relation between x[∗]

and x is singly reversible and affine. The defining equation

on the quadratic groundform (x, x). This converts (4) into the
fundamental equation of Pythagoras

(x, x) = eξ[2] + (x, x) (5)

which, for two displacements, may be generalised in the form

(x, y) = eξη + (x, y ). (5[′])

Its symbolic form is clear.
These considerations, in so far as they concern affine space,
may be applied directly. The complete space is the fourdimensional world: **e is any vector pointing in the direction**
of the future: the minor space is what we generally call space.
Each two world-points that lie on a world-line parallel to e project
into the same space-point. This space-point may be represented
graphically by the straight line parallel to e and may be indicated
permanently by a point-mass at rest, that is, one whose worldline is just that straight line. The metrical structure, however, is,
according to the Galilean principle of relativity, of a kind different
from that we assumed just above. This necessitates the following
modifications. Every world-displacement x has a definite duration t(x) = t (this takes the place of “height” in our geometrical
argument) and produces a displacement x in the minor space; it
splits up according to the formula

**x = t | x**

corresponding to the resolution into space and time. In particular
every space displacement x may be produced by one and only one

The space is dependent on the direction of projection. In actual
cases the direction of projection may be fixed by any point-mass
moving with uniform translation (or by the centre of mass of a
closed isolated mass-system).
We have set forth these details with pedantic accuracy so as to
be armed at least with a set of mathematical conceptions which
have been sifted into a form that makes them immediately applicable to Einstein’s principle of relativity for which our powers of
intuition are much more inadequate than for that of Galilei.
To return to the realm of physics. The discovery that light is
**propagated with a finite velocity gave the death-blow to the**
natural view that things exist simultaneously with their perception. As we possess no means of transmitting time-signals more
rapid than light itself (or wireless telegraphy) it is of course impossible to measure the velocity of light by measuring the time that
elapses whilst a light-signal emitted from a station A travels to a
station B. In 1675 Römer calculated this velocity from the apparent irregularity of the time of revolution of Jupiter’s moons, which
took place in a period which lasted exactly one year: he argued
that it would be absurd to assume a mutual action between the
earth and Jupiter’s satellites such that the period of the earth’s
revolution caused a disturbance of so considerable an amount in
the satellites. Fizeau confirmed the discovery by measurements
carried out on the earth’s surface. His method is based on the
simple idea of making the transmitting station A and the receiv


-----

that the centre of the disturbances is propagated in concentric
spheres with a constant velocity c. In our graphical picture (one
space-co-ordinate again being suppressed) the propagation of a
light-signal emitted at the world-point O is represented by the
circular cone depicted, which has the equation

_c[2]t[2]_ _−_ (x[2]1 [+][ x]2[2][) = 0][.] (6)

Every plane given by t = const. cuts the cone in a circle composed
of those points which the light-signal has reached at the moment t.
The equation (6) is satisfied by all and only by all those worldpoints reached by the light-signal (provided that t > 0). The
question again arises on what space of reference this description
of the event is based. The aberration of the stars shows that,
relatively to this reference space, the earth moves in agreement
with Newton’s theory, that is, that it is identical with an allowable
reference space as defined by Newtonian mechanics. The propagation in concentric spheres is, however, certainly not invariant
with respect to the Galilei transformations (III); for a t[′]-axis that
is drawn obliquely intersects the planes t = const. at points that
are excentric to the circles of propagation. Nevertheless, this cannot be regarded as an objection to Galilei’s principle of relativity,
if, accepting the ideas that have long held sway in physics, we assume that light is transmitted by a material medium, the æther,
whose particles are movable with regard to one another. The conditions that obtain in the case of light are exactly similar to those
that bring about concentric circles of waves on a surface of water
on to which a stone has been dropped. The latter phenomenon
certainly does not justify the conclusion that the equations of hy

ticles are at rest with respect to one another, if we neglect the
relatively small oscillations, furnishes us with the same system of
reference as that to which the statement concerning the concentric
transmission is referred.
To bring us into closer touch with this question we shall here
insert an account of optics in the theoretical guise that it has
preserved since the time of Maxwell under the name of the theory
of moving electromagnetic fields.

**§ 20. The Electrodynamics of Moving Fields Lorentz’s**
**Theorem of Relativity**

In passing from stationary electromagnetic fields to moving
electromagnetic fields (that is, to those that vary with the time)
we have learned the following:—
1. The so-called electric current is actually composed of moving electricity: a charged coil of wire in rotation produces a magnetic field according to the law of Biot and Savart. If ρ is the
density of charge, v the velocity, then clearly the density s of this
convection current = ρv; yet, if the Biot-Savart Law is to remain
valid in the old form, s must be measured in other units. Thus
we must set s = _[ρ]c[v]_ [, in which][ c][ is a universal constant having the]

dimensions of a velocity. The experiment carried out by Weber
and Kohlrausch, repeated later by Rowland and Eichenwald, gave
a value of c that was coincident with that obtained for the velocity
of light, within the limits of errors of observation (vide note 2).
We call _[ρ]_

_c_ [=][ ρ][′][ the electromagnetic measure of the charge-density]

of the field-intensity.
2. A moving magnetic field induces a current in a homogeneous
wire. It may be determined from the physical law s = σE and
**Faraday’s Law of Induction; the latter asserts that the induced**
electromotive force is equal to the time-decrement of the magnetic
flux through the conductor; hence we have

On the left there is the line-integral along a closed curve, on the
right the surface-integral of the normal components of the magnetic induction B, taken over a surface which fills the curve. The
flux of induction through the conducting curve is uniquely determined because
div B = 0; (8[′])

that is, there is no real magnetism. By Stokes’ Theorem we get
from (7) the differential law

Besides this, we have just as before

nuity (10). It is owing to the additional member [1]

_c_ _∂t_ [(Maxwell’s]

**displacement current), a differential co-efficient with respect**
to the time, that electromagnetic disturbances are propagated in
the æther with the finite velocity c. It is the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light, which interprets optical phenomena with
such wonderful success, and which is experimentally verified in the
well-known experiments of Hertz and in wireless telegraphy, one
of its technical applications. This also makes it clear that these
laws are referred to the same reference-space as that for which the
concentric propagation of light holds namely the “fixed” æther

According to the atomic theory of electrons these are generally
valid exact physical laws. This theory furthermore sets s = _[ρ]c[v]_ [,]

in which v denotes the velocity of the matter with which the
electric charge is associated.
The force which acts on the masses consists of components
arising from the electrical and the magnetic field: its density is

**p = ρE + [s, B].** (13)

Since s is parallel to v, the work performed on the electrons per
unit of time and of volume is

**p · v = ρE · v = c(s, E) = s · E[′].**

It is used in increasing the kinetic energy of the electrons, which
is partly transferred to the neutral molecules as a result of collisions. This augmented molecular motion in the interior of the
conductor expresses itself physically as the heat arising during this
phenomenon as was pointed out by Joule We find in fact ex

_æther has this property of invariance, namely, that these laws are_
_the expression of invariant relations between tensors which exist in_
_a four-dimensional affine space whose co-ordinates are t, x1, x2, x3_
_and upon which a non-definite metrical structure is impressed by_
_the form (17). This is the Lorentz-Einstein Theorem of Rel-_

To prove the theorem we shall choose a new unit of time by
putting ct = x0. The co-efficients of the metrical groundform are
then
_gik = 0_ (i ̸= k); _gii = ϵi,_

in which ϵ0 = −1, ϵ1 = ϵ2 = ϵ3 = +1; so that in passing from
components of a tensor that are co-variant with respect to an
index i to the contra-variant components of that tensor we have
only to multiply the ith component by the sign of ϵi. The question
of continuity for electricity (10) assumes the desired invariant form

and this is Maxwell’s first system of equations (12). We took a
circuitous route in using Lorentz’s solution and the potentials only
so as to be led naturally to the proper combination of the threedimensional quantities, which converts them into four-dimensional
vectors and tensors. By passing over to contra-variant components
we get

**E = (F** [01], F [02], F [03]), **B = (F** [23], F [31], F [12]).

of volume: p[0] = (s, E) [the unit of time is to be adapted to the
new measure of time x0 = ct], and p[1], p[2], p[3] are the components
of the density of force.

is possible in this formulation in terms of four-dimensional tensors.
Further, we learn from the above that, exactly as in the case

a corresponding decrease of the field-momentum distributed in

the field with a density **[S]**

from without. The current of the ith component of momentum
is given by t[(][i][)], and thus the momentum-flux is nothing more
than the Maxwell stress-tensor. The Theorem of the Conservation
_of Energy is only one component, the time-component, of a law_
_which is invariant for Lorentz transformations, the other compo-_
_nents being the space-components which express the conservation_
_of momentum._ The total energy as well as the total momentum remains unchanged: they merely stream from one part of
the field to another, and become transformed from field-energy
and field-momentum into kinetic-energy and kinetic-momentum
of matter, and vice versa. That is the simple physical meaning of
the formulæ (22). In accordance with it we shall in future refer
to the tensor S of the four-dimensional world as the energy**momentum-tensor or, more briefly, as the energy-tensor. Its**

symmetry tells us that the density of momentum = [1]

As long as we retain the picture of a material æther, capable of
executing vibrations, we can see in Lorentz’s Theorem of Relativity only a remarkable property of mathematical transformations;
the relativity theorem of Galilei and Newton remains the truly
valid one. We are, however, confronted with the task of interpreting not only optical phenomena but all electrodynamics and
its laws as the result of a mechanics of the æther which satisfies
Galilei’s Theorem of Relativity. To achieve this we must bring the
field-quantities into definite relationship with the density and velocity of the æther. Before the time of Maxwell’s electromagnetic
theory of light, attempts were made to do this for optical phenomena; these efforts were partly, but never wholly, crowned with
success. This attempt was not carried on (vide note 3) in the case

**it gradually began to win ground. Indeed, even Faraday had ex-**
pressed in unmistakable language that not the field should derive
its meaning through its association with matter, but, conversely,
rather that particles of matter are nothing more than singularities
of the field.

**§ 21. Einstein’s Principle of Relativity**

Let us for the present retain our conception of the æther. It
should be possible to determine the motion of a body, for example,
the earth, relative to the fixed or motionless æther. We are not
helped by aberration, for this only shows that this relative motion
**changes in the course of a year. Let A1, O, A2 be three fixed**
points on the earth that share in its motion. Suppose them to
lie in a straight line along the direction of the earth’s motion and
to be equidistant, so that A1O = OA2 = l, and let v be the
velocity of translation of the earth through the æther; let _[v]_

_c_ [=][ q][,]
which we shall assume to be a very small quantity. A light-signal

_l_
emitted at O will reach A2 after a time
_c −_ _v_ [has elapsed, and]

_l_
_A1 after a time_
_c + v_ [. Unfortunately, this difference cannot be]

demonstrated, as we have no signal that is more rapid than light
and that we could use to communicate the time to another place.[∗]

_∗It might occur to us to transmit time from one world-point to another by_
carrying a clock that is marking time from one place to the other. In practice,
this process is not sufficiently accurate for our purpose. Theoretically, it is

will reach A after a time

whereas that reflected from A1 reaches O after a time

_l_ _l_ 2lc
_c + v_ [+] _c −_ _v_ [=] _c[2]_ _−_ _v[2]_ _[.]_

There is now no longer a difference in the times. Let us, however,
now assume a third point A which participates in the translational
motion through the æther, such that OA = l, but that OA makes
an angle θ with the direction of OA. In Fig. 8, O, O[′], O[′′] are the
successive positions of the point O at the time 0 at which the signal
is emitted, at the time t[′] at which it is reflected from the mirror A
placed at A[′], and finally at the time t[′] + t[′′] at which it again
reaches O, respectively. From the figure we get the proportion

_OA[′]_ : O[′′]A[′] = OO[′] : O[′′]O[′].

Consequently the two angles at A[′] are equal to one another. The
reflecting mirror must be placed, just as when the system is at
rest, perpendicularly to the rigid connecting line OA, in order
that the light-ray may return to O. An elementary trigonometrical
calculation gives for the apparent rate of transmission in the
**direction θ**

It is thus dependent on the angle θ, which gives the direction of
transmission. Observations of the value of θ should enable us to
determine the direction and magnitude of v.
These observations were attempted in the celebrated
**Michelson-Morley experiment (vide note 4).** In this, two
mirrors A, A[′] are rigidly fixed to O at distances l, l[′], the one
along the line of motion the other perpendicular to it. The whole
apparatus may be rotated about O. By means of a transparent
glass plate, one-half of which is silvered and which bisects the
right angle at O, a light-ray is split up into two halves, one of
which travels to A, the other to A[′]. They are reflected at these
two points; and at O, owing to the partly silvered mirror, they
are again combined to a single composite ray. We take l and l[′]

approximately equal; then, owing to the difference in path given
by (24), namely,

strange result by the bold hypothesis that a rigid body in moving
relatively to the æther undergoes a contraction in the direction of
the line of motion in the ratio 1 : �1 − _q[2]. This would actually_

account for the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
For there, OA has in the first position the true length l�1 − _q[2],_

and OA[′] the length l[′], whereas in the second position OA has the
true length l but OA[′] the length l[′] _·_ �1 − _q[2]. The difference of_

path would, in each case, be [2(][l][ −] _[l][′][)]_
�1 − _q[2]_ [.]

It was also found that, no matter into what direction a mirror
rigidly fixed to O was turned, the same apparent velocity of trans_√_
mission _c[2]_ _−_ _v[2]_ was obtained for all directions; that is, that this

velocity did not depend on the direction θ, in the manner given
by (24). Nevertheless, theoretically, it still seemed possible to
demonstrate the decrease of the velocity of transmission from c
_√_
to _c[2]_ _−_ _v[2]. But if the æther shortens the measuring rods in the_

direction of motion in the ratio 1 : �1 − _q[2], it need only retard_

clocks in the same ratio to hide this effect, too. In fact, not only
_the Michelson-Morley experiment but a whole series of further ex-_
_periments designed to demonstrate that the earth’s motion has an_
_influence on combined mechanical and electromagnetic phenom-_
_ena, have led to a null result (vide note 5). Æther mechanics has_
thus to account not only for Maxwell’s laws but also for this remarkable interaction between matter and æther. It seems that
the æther has betaken itself to the land of the shades in a final
effort to elude the inquisitive search of the physicist!
The only reasonable answer that was given to the question as
to why a translation in the æther cannot be distinguished from

sis and one, moreover, that has acted very poorly in the face of
facts.) The position is then this: for mechanics we get Galilei’s
Theorem of Relativity, for electrodynamics, Lorentz’s Theorem.
If this is really the case, they neutralise one another and thereby
define an absolute space of reference in which mechanical laws
have the Newtonian form, electrodynamical laws that given by
Maxwell. The difficulty of explaining the null result of the experiments whose purpose was to distinguish translation from rest, is
overcome only by regarding one or other of these two principles
of relativity as being valid for all physical phenomena. That of
Galilei does not come into question for electrodynamics as this
would mean that, in Maxwell’s theory, those terms by which we
distinguish moving fields from stationary ones would not occur:
there would be no induction, no light, and no wireless telegraphy. On the other hand, even the contraction theory of LorentzFitzgerald suggests that Newton’s mechanics may be modified so
that it satisfies the Lorentz-Einstein Theorem of Relativity, the

deviations that occur being only of the order ; they are then

easily within reach of observation for all velocities v of planets or
on the earth. The solution of Einstein (vide note 6), which at one
stroke overcomes all difficulties, is then this: the world is a four_dimensional affine space whose metrical structure is determined_
_by a non-definite quadratic form_

_Q(x) = (x, x)_

_which has one negative and three positive dimensions. All physical_
quantities are scalars and tensors of this four-dimensional world

signal which has been emitted at the world-point O arrives at all
those and only those world-points A for which x = _[−→]OA belongs to_
the one of the two conical sheets defined by the equation Q(x) = 0
(cf. § 4). Hence that sheet (of the two cones) which “opens into
the future” namely, Q(x) ≤ 0 is distinguished objectively from
that which opens into the past. By introducing an appropriate
“normal” co-ordinate system consisting of the zero point O and
the fundamental vectors ei, we may bring Q(x) into the normal
form
(OA,[−→] _[−→]OA) = −x[2]0_ [+][ x]1[2] [+][ x]2[2] [+][ x]3[2][,]

in which the xi’s are the co-ordinates of A; in addition, the fundamental vector e0 is to belong to the cone opening into the future.
**It is impossible to narrow down the selection from these**
**normal co-ordinate systems any farther: that is, none are**
specially favoured; they are all equivalent. If we make use of a
particular one, then x0 must be regarded as the time; x1, x2, x3
as the Cartesian space co-ordinates; and all the ordinary expressions referring to space and time are to be used in this system
of reference as usual. The adequate mathematical formulation of
Einstein’s discovery was first given by Minkowski (vide note 7):
to him we are indebted for the idea of four-dimensional worldgeometry, on which we based our argument from the outset.
How the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment comes
about is now clear. For if the interactions of the cohesive forces of
matter as well as the transmission of light takes place according
to Einstein’s Principle of Relativity, measuring rods must behave

nised even by Lorentz, we must indeed regard the Michelson_Morley experiment as a proof that the mechanics of rigid bodies_
_must, strictly speaking, be in accordance not with that of Galilei’s_
_Principle of Relativity, but with that of Einstein._
It is clear that this is mathematically much simpler and more
intelligible than the former: world-geometry has been brought into
closer touch with Euclidean space-geometry through Einstein and
Minkowski. Moreover, as may easily be shown, Galilei’s principle is found to be a limiting case of Einstein’s world-geometry by
making c converge to ∞. The physical purport of this is that we
_are to discard our belief in the objective meaning of simultaneity;_
_it was the great achievement of Einstein in the field of the theory_
_of knowledge that he banished this dogma from our minds, and this_
is what leads us to rank his name with that of Copernicus. The
graphical picture given at the end of the preceding paragraph discloses immediately that the planes x[′]0 [=][ const. no longer coincide]
with the planes x0 = const. In consequence of the metrical structure of the world, which is based on Q(x), each plane x[′]0 [=][ const.]
has a measure-determination such that the ellipse in which it intersects the “light-cone,” is a circle, and that Euclidean geometry
holds for it. The point at which it is punctured by the x[′]0[-axis is]
the mid-point of the elliptical section. So the propagation of light
takes place in the “accented” system of reference, too, in concentric
circles.
We shall next endeavour to eradicate the difficulties that seem
to our intuition, our inner knowledge of space and time, to be
involved in the revolution caused by Einstein in the conception
of time. According to the ordinary view the following is true.

than O; I cannot shoot back into the past. Similarly, an event
which happens at O has an influence only on what happens at
later world-points, whereas “one can no longer undo” the past:
the extreme limit is reached by gravitation, acting according to
Newton’s law of attraction, as a result of which, for example, by
extending my arm, I at the identical moment produce an effect
on the planets, modifying their orbits ever so slightly. If we again
suppress a space-co-ordinate and use our graphical mode of representation, then the absolute meaning of the plane t = 0 which
passes through O consists in the fact that it separates the “future”
world-points, which can be influenced by actions at O, from the
“past” world-points from which an effect may be conveyed to or
conferred on O. According to Einstein’s Principle of Relativity,
we get in place of the plane of separation t = 0 the light cone

_x[2]1_ [+][ x]2[2] _[−]_ _[c][2][t][2][ = 0]_

(which degenerates to the above double plane when c = ∞). This
makes the position clear in this way. The direction of all bodies
projected from O must point into the forward-cone, opening into
the future (so also the direction of the world-line of my own body,
my “life-curve” if I happen to be at O). Events at O can influence
only happenings that occur at world-points that lie within this
forward-cone: the limits are marked out by the resulting propagation of light into empty space.[∗] If I happen to be at O, then

_∗The propagation of gravitational force must, of course, likewise take place_
with the speed of light, according to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. The law
for the gravitational potential must be modified in a manner analogous to

caused. As far as my relationship to the world is concerned, however, the forward-cone comprises all the world-points which are affected by my active or passive doings at O, whereas all events that
are complete in the past, that can no longer be altered, lie externally to this cone. The sheet of the forward-cone separates
**my active future from my active past. On the other hand,**
the interior of the backward-cone includes all events in which I

**sive past from my passive future. The sheet itself contains**
everything on its surface that I see at this moment, or can see;
it is thus properly the picture of my external surroundings. In
the fact that we must in this way distinguish between active and
**passive, present, and future, there lies the fundamental impor-**
tance of Römer’s discovery of the finite velocity of light to which
Einstein’s Principle of Relativity first gave full expression. The
plane t = 0 passing through O in an allowable co-ordinate system
may be placed so that it cuts the light-cone Q(x) = 0 only at O
and thereby separates the cone of the active future from the cone
of the passive past.
For a body moving with uniform translation it is always possible to choose an allowable co-ordinate system (= normal coordinate system) such that the body is at rest in it. The individual parts of the body are then separated by definite distances
from one another, the straight lines connecting them make definite
angles with one another, and so forth, all of which may be calculated by means of the formulæ of ordinary analytical geometry
from the space-co-ordinates x1, x2, x3 of the points under consideration in the allowable co-ordinate system chosen. I shall term
them the static measures of the body (this defines, in particular, the static length of a measuring rod). If this body is a clock,
in which a periodical event occurs, there will be associated with
this period in the system of reference, in which the clock is at rest,
a definite time, determined by the increase of the co-ordinate x0
during a period; we shall call this the “proper time” of the clock.
If we push the body at one and the same moment at different
points, these points will begin to move, but as the effect can at

panding spheres encircling each point of attack and travelling with
the velocity of light do not overlap, the parts surrounding these
points that are dragged along move independently of one another.
It is evident from this that, according to the theory of relativity,
there cannot be rigid bodies in the old sense; that is, no body exists which remains objectively always the same no matter to what
influences it has been subjected. How is it that in spite of this
we can use our measuring rods for carrying out measurements in
space? We shall use an analogy. If a gas that is in equilibrium in
a closed vessel is heated at various points by small flames and is
then removed adiabatically, it will at first pass through a series of
complicated stages, which will not satisfy the equilibrium laws of
thermodynamics. Finally, however, it will attain a new state of
equilibrium corresponding to the new quantity of energy it contains, which is now greater owing to the heating. We require
of a rigid body that is to be used for purposes of measurement
(in particular, a linear measuring rod) that, after coming to
**rest in an allowable system of reference, it shall always re-**
main exactly the same as before, that is, that it shall have the
**same static measures (or static length); and we require of a**
**clock that goes correctly that it shall always have the same**
**proper-time when it has come to rest (as a whole) in an**
**allowable system of reference. We may assume that the mea-**
suring rods and clocks which we shall use satisfy this condition
to a sufficient degree of approximation. It is only when, in our
analogy, the gas is warmed sufficiently slowly (strictly speaking,
infinitely slowly) that it will pass through a series of thermodynamic states of equilibrium; only when we move the measuring

about this point can be made only when we have built up a dy**namics based on physical and mechanical laws.**
To get a clear picture of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction
from the point of view of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, we shall
imagine the following to take place in a plane. In an allowable
system of reference (co-ordinates t, x1, x2, one space-co-ordinate
being suppressed), to which the following space-time expressions
will be referred, there is at rest a plane sheet of paper (carrying
rectangular co-ordinates x1, x2 marked on it), on which a closed
curve c is drawn. We have, besides, a circular plate carrying a
rigid clock-hand that rotates around its centre, so that its point
traces out the edge of the plate if it is rotated slowly, thus proving
that the edge is actually a circle. Let the plate now move along the
sheet of paper with uniform translation. If, at the same time, the
index rotates slowly, its point runs unceasingly along the edge of
the plate: in this sense the disc is circular during translation too.
Suppose the edge of the disc to coincide exactly with the curve c
at a definite moment. If we measure c by means of measuring rods
that are at rest, we find that c is not a circle but an ellipse. This
phenomenon is shown graphically in Fig. 11. We have added the
system of reference t[′], x[′]1[,][ x][′]2 [with respect to which the disc is at]
rest. Any plane t[′] = const. intersects the light cone in this system
of reference in a circle “that exists for a single moment”. The
cylinder above it erected in the direction of the t[′]-axis represents
a circle that is at rest in the accented system, and hence marks
off that part of the world which is passed over by our disc. The


-----

p g g y
of the t-axis represents the constantly present curve traced on the
paper.
If we now inquire what physical laws are necessary to distinguish normal co-ordinate systems from all other co-ordinate systems (in Riemann’s sense), we learn that we require only Galilei’s
Principle of Relativity and the law of the propagation of light; by
means of light-signals and point-masses moving under no forces—
even if we have only small limits of velocity within which the
latter may move—we are in a position to fix a co-ordinate system
of this kind. To see this we shall next add a corollary to Galilei’s
Principle of Inertia. If a clock shares in the motion of the pointmass moving under no forces, then its time-data are a measure of
the “proper-time” s of the motion. Galilei’s principle states that
the world-line of the point is a straight line; we elaborate this by
stating further that the moments of the motion characterised by

_t_ _t[′]_

-----

q p g g y g
the parameter of proper-time to distinguish the various stages of
the motion we get not only a line in the four-dimensional world
but also a “motion” in it (cf. the definition on page 155) and according to Galilei this motion is a translation.
The world-points constitute a four-dimensional manifold; this
is perhaps the most certain fact of our empirical knowledge. We
shall call a system of four co-ordinates xi (i = 0, 1, 2, 3), which are
used to fix these points in a certain portion of the world, a lin**ear co-ordinate system, if the motion of point-mass under no**
forces and expressed in terms of the parameter s of the proper-time
be represented by formulæ in which the xi’s are linear functions
of s. The fact that there are such co-ordinate systems is what
the law of inertia really asserts. After this condition of linearity,
all that is necessary to define the co-ordinate system fully is a
linear transformation. That is, if xi, x[′]i [are the co-ordinates re-]
spectively of one and the same world-point in two different linear
co-ordinate systems, then the x[′]i[’s a must be linear functions of]
the x’s. By simultaneously interpreting the xi’s as Cartesian coordinates in a four-dimensional Euclidean space, the co-ordinate
system furnishes us with a representation of the world (or of the
portion of world in which the xi’s exist) on a Euclidean space
of representation. We may, therefore, formulate our proposition
thus. A representation of two Euclidean spaces by one another
(or in other words a transformation from one Euclidean space to
another), such that straight lines become straight lines and a series of equidistant points become a series of equidistant points
is necessarily an affine transformation. Fig. 12 which represents
Möbius’ mesh-construction (vide note 8) may suffice to indicate

posing it may be derived from a given, arbitrarily thin, cone carrying these directions on it; the above geometrical theorem remains

Fig. 12.

valid even if we only know that the straight lines whose directions
belong to this cone become straight lines again as a result of the
transformation.
Galilei’s Principle of Inertia is sufficient in itself to prove conclusively that the world is affine in character: it will not, however, allow us deduce any further result. The metrical groundform (x, x) of the world is now accounted for by the process of
light-propagation. A light-signal emitted from O arrives at the
world-point A if, and only if, x = _[−→]OA belongs to one of the_
two conical sheets defined by (x, x) = 0. This determines the
quadratic form except for a constant factor; to fix the latter we
must choose an arbitrary unit-measure (cf. Appendix I).

**§** **y,** **,** **p**

We shall call a world-vector x space-like or time-like, according as (x, x) is positive or negative. Time-like vectors are divided
into those that point into the future and those that point into
the past. We shall call the invariant

∆s = �−(x, x) (25)

of a time-like vector x which points into the future its proper**time. If we set**
**x = ∆s · e**

then e, the direction of the time-like displacement, is a vector that
points into the future, and that satisfies the condition of normality
(e, e) = −1.
As in Galilean geometry, so in Einstein’s world-geometry we
must resolve the world into space and time by projection
in the direction of a time-like vector e pointing into the future
and normalised by the condition (e, e) = −1. The process of projection was discussed in detail in § 19. The fundamental formulæ
(3), (5), (5[′]) that are set up must here be applied with e = −1.[∗]

World-points for which the vector connecting them is proportional
to e coincide at a space-point which we may mark by means of a
point-mass at rest, and which we may represent graphically by a
world-line (straight) parallel to e. The three-dimensional space Re
that is generated by the projection has a metrical character that
is Euclidean since, for every vector x[∗] which is orthogonal to e,

_∗Here the units of space and time are chosen so that the velocity of_
light in vacuo becomes equal to 1. To arrive at the ordinary units of the


-----

, y ( _, )_,
(x[∗], x[∗]) is a positive quantity (except in the case in which x[∗] = 0;
cf. § 4). Every displacement x of the world may be split up according to the formula

**x = ∆t | x :**

∆t is its duration (called “height” in § 19): x is the displacement
it produces in the space Re.
If e1, e2, e3 form a co-ordinate system in Re, then the worlddisplacements e1, e2, e3 that are orthogonal to e = e0, and that
produce the three given space-displacements, form in conjunction
with e0 a co-ordinate system, which belongs to Re, for the
world-points. It is normal if the three vectors ei in Re form a
Cartesian co-ordinate system. In every case the system of coefficients of the metrical groundform has, in it, the form

_−1_ 0 0 0

0 _g21_ _g22_ _g23_

�������� ��������

The proper time ∆s of a time-like vector x pointing into the
future (and for which x = ∆s · e) is equal to the duration of x
in the space of reference Re, in which x calls forth no spatial displacement. In the sequel we shall have to contrast several ways of
splitting up quantities into terms of the vectors e, e[′], . . . ; e (with
or without an index) is always to denote a time-like world-vector
pointing into the future and satisfying the condition of normality
(e, e) = −1.
Let K be a body at rest in R _K_ _[′]_ a body at rest in R _[′]_


-----

, g **e**

_e[′]_ = h | hv (26)

then K _[′]_ undergoes the space-displacement hv during the time (i.e.
with the duration) h in Re. Accordingly, v is the velocity of K _[′]_

in Re or the relative velocity of K _[′]_ **with respect to K. Its**
magnitude is determined by v[2] = (v _, v_ ). By (3) we have

_h = −(e[′], e);_ (27)

on the other hand, by (5)

1 = −(e[′], e[′]) = h[2] _−_ _h[2](v_ _, v_ ) = h[2](1 − _v[2]),_


thus we get


1
_h =_ _√_ (28)

1 − _v[2]_ _[.]_


If, between two moments of K _[′]’s motion, it undergoes the world-_
displacement ∆s·e[′], (26) shows that h·∆s = ∆t is the duration of
this displacement in Re. The proper time ∆s and the duration ∆t
of the displacement in Re are related by


_√_
∆s = ∆t


1 − _v[2]._ (29)


Since (27) is symmetrical in e and e[′], (28) teaches us that the
**magnitude of the relative velocity of K** _[′]_ **with respect to K**
**is equal to that of K with respect to K** _[′]._ The vectorial
relative velocities cannot be compared with one another since
the one exists in the space Re, the other in the space Re[′] [.]

Then
_−(e1, e2) = h1h2�1 −_ (v1v2)�.


Hence, if K1 and K2 have velocities v1, v2 respectively in Re, with
numerical values v1, v2, then if these velocities v1, v2 make an
angle θ with each other, and if v12 = v21 is the magnitude of the
velocity of K2 relatively to K1 (or vice versa), we find that the
formula
1 − _v1v2 cos θ_ 1

= (30)

�1 − _v1[2]�1 −_ _v2[2]_ �1 − _v12[2]_

holds: it shows how the relative velocity of two bodies is
**determined from their given velocities. If, using hyperbolic**
functions, we set v = tanh v for each of the values v of the velocity
(v being < 1), we get

cosh u1 cosh u2 − sinh u1 sinh u2 cos θ = cosh u12.

This formula becomes the cosine theorem of spherical geometry if we replace the hyperbolic functions by their corresponding
trigonometrical functions; thus u is the side opposite the angle θ

Analogous to the relationship (29) between time and propertime, there is one between length and statical-length. We shall
use Re as our space of reference. Let the individual point-masses
of the body at a definite moment be at the world-points O, A, . . . .
The space-points O, A, . . . at Re at which they are situated form
a figure in Re, on which we can confer duration, by making the
body leave behind it a copy of itself at the moment under consideration in the space Re; an example of this was presented in the
illustration given at the close of the preceding paragraph. If, on
the other hand, the world-points O, A, . . . are at the space-points
_O_ _[′], A[′], . . . in the space Re in which K_ _[′]_ is at rest, then O[′], A[′], . . .
constitute the statical shape of the body K _[′]_ (cf. Fig. 13, in which
orthogonal world-distances are drawn perpendicularly). There is
a transformation that connects the part of Re, which receives the

projection). Since the world-points O, A are simultaneous for
the partition into e, we have

_OA = x = 0 | x in Re, and x =_ _[−→]OA._

By formula (5)

_−→2_
_OA_ = (x, x) = (x, x),
_−−→_
_O[′]A[′][2]_ = (x, x) + (x, e[′])[2].

If, however, we determine (x, e[′]) in Re by (5[′]) we get

(x, e[′]) = h(x, v ),

and hence

If we use a Cartesian co-ordinate system x1, x2, x3 in Re with O as
origin, and having its x1-axis in the direction of the velocity v, then
if x1, x2, x3 are the co-ordinates of A, we have

dilatation of the imprinted copy in the ratio 1 : 1 − _v[2]_ along the

direction of the body’s motion. Our formulæ assert that the copy
thereby assumes a shape congruent to that of the body when at
rest; this is the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction. In particular,
the volume V that the body K _[′]_ occupies at a definite moment in
the space Re is connected to its statical volume V0 by the relation


_√_
_V = V0_


1 − _v[2]._


Whenever we measure angles by optical means we determine
the angles formed by the light-rays for the system of reference in
which the (rigid) measuring instrument is at rest. Again, when our
_eyes take the place of these instruments it is these angles that de-_
_termine the visual form of objects that lie within the field of vision._
To establish the relationship between geometry and the observation of geometrical magnitudes, we must therefore take optical
considerations into account. The solution of Maxwell’s equations
for light-rays in the æther as well as in a homogeneous medium,
which is at rest in an allowable reference system, is of a form
such that the component of the “phase” quantities (in complex
notation) are all
= const. e[2][πi][Θ(][P] [)]

in which Θ = Θ(P ) is, with the omission of an additive constant,
the phase determined by the conditions set down; it is a function
of the world-point which here occurs as the argument. If the world
co-ordinates are transformed linearly in any way, the components
in the new co-ordinate system will again have the same form with


-----

p ( g )
real function of the world-co-ordinates of P ; hence the phasedifference at two arbitrary points Θ(B) − Θ(A) is a linear form of
the arbitrary displacement x = _[−→]AB, that is, a co-variant world-_
vector. If we represent this by the corresponding displacement l
(we shall allude to it briefly as the light-ray l) then

Θ(B) − Θ(A) = (l, x).

If we split it up by means of the time-like vector e into space and
time and set
**l = ν |** _[ν]q_ _[a]_ (32)

so that the space-vector a in Re is of unit length

**x = ∆t | x,**

then the phase-difference is

� (a, x) �
_ν_ _−_ ∆t _._

_q_

From this we see that ν signifies the frequency, q the velocity of
transmission, and a the direction of the light-ray in the space Re.
Maxwell’s equations tell us that in the æther the velocity of transmission q = 1, or that
(l, l) = 0.

If we split the world up into space and time in two ways,
firstly by means of e, secondly by means of e[′], and distinguish
the magnitudes derived from the second process by accents we
immediately find as a result of the invariance of (l, l) the law

Finally, to get the relationship between the frequencies ν and ν[′]

we assume a body that is at rest in Re[′] [; let it have the velocity][ v]
in the space Re, then, as before, we must set

**e[′]** = h | hv in Re. (26)

sodium-molecule moving with a velocity ν, both frequencies being observed in a spectroscope which is at rest; θ is the angle
between the direction of motion of the molecule and the light-ray
which enters the spectroscope. If we substitute (36) in (33) we get
an equation between q and q[′] which enables us to calculate the
velocity of propagation q in a moving medium from the velocity of
propagation q[′] in the same medium at rest; for example, in water,
_v now represents the rate of flow of the water; θ represents the_
angle that the direction of flow of the water makes with the lightrays. If we suppose these two directions to coincide, and then
neglect powers of v higher than the first (since v is in practice
very small compared with the velocity of light), we get

_q = q[′]_ + v(1 − _q[′][2]);_

that is, not the whole of the velocity v of the medium is added

to the velocity of propagation, but only the fraction 1 − [1]

which q = q[′] = 1 (cf. (35)), to be

If the reference-space Re happens to be the one on which the theory of planets is commonly founded (and in which the centre of

system from two infinitely distant stars make with one another,

observed from the earth, is determined by the preceding equation.
We cannot, of course, measure ω, but we note the changes in ω[′]

(the aberration) by taking account of the changes in θ1 and θ2
in the course of a year.
The formulæ which give the relationship between time, propertime, volume and statical volume are also valid in the case of non**uniform motion. If dx is the infinitesimal displacement that a**

a clock that is rigidly attached to the point-mass. If we use any
linear co-ordinates xi whatsoever in the world, and the propertime s as our parameters to represent our world-line analytically

to rest, and we derive the proposition (37) which states that the
proper-time lags behind the time t. The life-processes of mankind
may well be compared to a clock. Suppose we have two twinbrothers who take leave from one another at a world-point A, and
suppose one remains at home (that is, permanently at rest in an
allowable reference-space), whilst the other sets out on voyages,
during which he moves with velocities (relative to “home”) that
approximate to that of light. When the wanderer returns home in
later years he will appear appreciably younger than the one who

Maxwell’s phenomenological theory of electricity, the concealed
motions of the electrons are not taken into account as motions
of matter, consequently electricity is not supposed attached to
matter in his theory. The only way to explain how it is that a
piece of matter carries a certain charge is to say this charge is that
which is simultaneously in the portion of space that is occupied
by the matter at the moment under consideration. From this
we see that the charge is not, as in the theory of electrons, an
invariant determined by the portion of matter, but is dependent
on the way the world has been split up into space and time.

**§** **y** **g**

By splitting up the world into space and time we split up all
tensors. We shall first of all investigate purely mathematically
how this comes about, and shall then apply the results to derive
the fundamental equations of electrodynamics for moving bodies.
Let us take an n-dimensional metrical space, which we shall call
“world,” based on the metrical groundform (x, x). Let e be a
vector in it, for which (e, e) = e ̸= 0. We split up the world
in the usual way into space Re and time in terms of e. Let e1,
_e2, . . ., en−1 be any co-ordinate system in the space Re, and let e1,_
**e2, . . ., en−1 be the displacements of the world that are orthogonal**
to e = e0 and that are produced in Re by e1, e2, . . ., en−1. In the
co-ordinate system ei (i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., n _−_ 1) “belonging to Re” and
representing the world, the scheme of the co-variant components
of the metrical ground-tensor has the form

_e_ 0 0
0 _g11_ _g12_ (n = 3).
0 _g21_ _g22_

������ ������

As an example, we shall consider a tensor of the second order
and suppose it to have components Tik in this co-ordinate system.
Now, we assert that it splits up, in a manner dependent only on e,
according to the following scheme:

_T00_ _T01_ _T02_
_T10_ _T11_ _T12_
_T20_ _T21_ _T22_

that is into a scalar two vectors and a tensor of the second order


-----

y _i_ [(] _,,_ _,_ )
For if the arbitrary world-displacement x splits up in terms
of e thus
**x = ξ | x**

and if, when we divide x into two factors, one of which is proportional to e and the other orthogonal to e, we have

**x = ξe + x[∗]**

then, if x has components ξ[i], we get


_n−1_
� _ξ[i]ei,_ _x =_

_i=1_


_n−1_
�

_ξ[i]ei._
_i=1_


**x =**


_n−1_
�

_ξ[i]ei,_ _ξ = ξ[0],_ **x[∗]** =
_i=0_


Thus, without using a co-ordinate system we may represent the
splitting up of a tensor in the following manner. If x, y are any
two arbitrary displacements of the world, and if we set

**x = ξe + x[∗],** **y = ηe + y[∗],** (38)

so that x[∗] and y[∗] are orthogonal to e, then the bilinear form
belonging to the tensor of the second order is

_T_ (x, y) = ξηT (e, e) + ηT (x[∗], e) + ξT (e, y[∗]) + T (x[∗], y[∗]).

Hence, if we interpret x[∗], y[∗] as the displacements of the world
orthogonal to e, which produce the two arbitrary displacements
_x, y of the space, we get_
1. a scalar T (e, e) = J = J,
2. two linear forms (vectors) in the space Re, defined by

( ) p **e[,]** y

_T_ (x, y ) = T (x[∗], y[∗]).

If x, y are arbitrary world-displacements that produce x, y, respectively in Re we must replace x[∗], y[∗] in this definition by x−ξe,

in § 20. H. Hertz was the first to attempt to extend them so that
they might apply generally for moving bodies. Faraday’s Law of
Induction states that the time-decrement of the flux of induction
enclosed in a conductor is equal to the induced electromotive force,
that is

_d_ � �

_−[1]_ _Bn do =_ **E dr.** (40)

_c_ _dt_

The surface-integral on the left, if the conductor be in motion,
must be taken over a surface stretched out inside the conductor
and moving with it. Since Faraday’s Law of Induction has been
proved for just those cases in which the time-change of the flux of
induction within the conductor is brought about by the motion of
the conductor, Hertz did not doubt that this law was equally valid
for the case, too, when the conductor was in motion. The equation
div B = 0 remains unaffected. From vector analysis we know that,
taking this equation into consideration, the law of induction (40)
may be expressed in the differential form:

_∂B_

curl E = −[1] (41)

_c_ _∂t_ [+ ][1]c [curl[][v][,][ B][]]


in which _[∂][B]_

_∂t_ [denotes the differential co-efficient of][ B][ with respect]
to the time for a fixed point in space, and v denotes the velocity
of the matter.
Remarkable inferences may be drawn from (41). As in Wilson’s
experiment (vide note 10), we suppose a homogeneous dielectric
between the two plates of a condenser, and assume that this dielectric moves with a constant velocity of magnitude v between


-----

g pp,, g
magnetic field H parallel to the plates and perpendicular to v. We
shall imagine the dielectric separated from the plates of the condenser by a narrow empty space, whose thickness we shall assume
_→_ 0 in the limit. It then follows from (41) that, in the space be
tween the plates, E − [1]

_c_ [[][v][,][ B][]][ is derivable from a potential; since]
the latter must be zero at the plates which are connected by a

conducting wire it is easily seen that we must have E = [1]

_c_ [[][v][,][ B][]][.]

Hence a homogeneous electric field of intensity E = _[µ]_

_c [vH][ (in]_

which µ denotes permeability) arises which acts perpendicularly
to the plates. Consequently, a statical charge of surface-density
_ϵµ_

_c [vH][ (][ϵ][ =][ dielectric constant) must be called up on the plates.]_

If the dielectric is a gas, this effect should manifest itself, no matter to what degree the gas
has been rarefied, since ϵµ converges, not towards 0, but towards 1, at infinite rarefaction.
This can have only one meaning if we are to
retain our belief in the æther, namely, that
the effect must occur if the æther between the
plates is moving relatively to the plates and to **v**
the æther outside them. To explain induction
we should, however, be compelled to assume
that the æther is dragged along by the connecting wire.[∗] General observations, Fizeau’s Fig. 14.

which vanishes when ϵµ = 1. This seems to be an inexplicable
contradiction to the phenomenon of induction in the moving conductor.
The theory of relativity offers a full explanation of this. If, as
in § 20, we again set ct = x0, and if we again build up a field F
out of E and B, and a skew-symmetrical tensor H of the second
order out of D and H, we have the field-equations

These hold if we regard the Fik’s as co-variant, the H _[ik]’s as contra-_

but the s[i]’s as the contra-variant components of a vector in the
four-dimensional world, since the latter are invariant in any arbitrary linear co-ordinate system. The laws of matter

**D = ϵE,** **B = µH,** **s = σE**

This is the invariant form of these laws. For purposes of calculation it is convenient to replace (44) by the equations

_Fklui + Fliuk + Fikul = µ{Hklui + Hliuk + Hikul}_ (46)

which are derived directly from them. Our manner of deriving
them makes it clear that they hold only for matter which is in
uniform translation. We may, however, consider them as being
valid also for a single body in uniform translation, if it is separated
by empty space from bodies moving with velocities differing from
its own.[∗] Finally, they may also be considered to hold for matter
moving in any manner whatsoever, provided that its velocity does

form in this way, we may now split up the world in terms of any
arbitrary e. Suppose the measuring instruments that are used to
determine the ponderomotive effects of field to be at rest in Re.
We shall use a co-ordinate system belonging to Re and thus set

(F10, _F20,_ _F30) = (E1,_ _E2,_ _E3) = E,_
(F23, _F31,_ _F12) = (B23,_ _B31,_ _B12) = B,_

we hereby again arrive at Maxwell’s field-equations, which
**are thus valid in a totally unchanged form, not only for**
**static, but also for moving matter. Does this not, however,**
conflict violently with the observations of induction, which appear
to require the addition of a term as in (41)? No; for these observations do not really determine the intensity of field E, but only the
current which flows in the conductor; for moving bodies, however,
the connection between the two is given by a different equation,
namely, by (45).
If we write down those equations of (43), (45), which correspond to the components with indices i = 1, 2, 3, and those of (46),
which correspond to

(i, k, l) = (2, 3, 0), (3, 1, 0), (1, 2, 0)

**E + [v, B] = E[∗],** **D+[v, H]= D[∗],**
**B −** [v, E] = B[∗], **H−[v, D]= H[∗],**

then
**D[∗]** = ϵE[∗], **B[∗]** = µH[∗].

If, in addition, we resolve s into the “convection-current” c and
the “conduction-current” s[∗], that is,

**s = c + s[∗],**

**c = ρ[∗]v,** _ρ[∗]_ = _[ρ][ −]_ [(][v][,][ s][)] = ρ − (v, s[∗]),

1 − _v[2]_


then
_σE[∗]_

1 − _v[2]_ _[.]_

Everything now becomes clear: the current is composed partly
of a convection-current which is due to the motion of charged
matter, and partly of a conduction-current, which is determined
by the conductivity σ of the substance. The conduction-current is
calculated from Ohm’s Law, if the electromotive force is defined
by the line-integral, not of E, but of E[∗]. An equation exactly
analogous to (41) holds for E[∗], namely:

curl E[∗] = −[∂][B] (we now always take c = 1)

conductors. For Wilson’s experiment, according to the present
theory, curl E = 0, that is, E will be zero between the plates. This
gives us the constant values of the individual vectors (of which the
electrical ones are perpendicular to the plates, whilst the magnetic
ones are directed parallel to the plates and perpendicular to the
velocity): these values are:

_E[∗]_ = vB[∗] = vµH _[∗]_ = µv(H + vD),
_D = D[∗]_ _−_ _vH = ϵE[∗]_ _−_ _vH._

If we substitute the expression for E[∗] in the first equation, we get

_D = v�(ϵµ −_ 1)H + ϵµvD�,

_ϵµ −_ 1
_D =_
1 − _ϵµv[2]_ _[vH.]_

This is the value of the superficial density of charge that is called
up on the condenser plates: it agrees with our observations since,
on account of v being very small, the denominator in our formula
differs very little from unity.
The boundary conditions at the boundary between the matter
and the æther are obtained from the consideration that the fieldmagnitudes F and H must not suffer any sudden (discontinuous)
changes in moving along with the matter; but, in general, they
will undergo a sudden change, at some fixed space-point imagined
in the æther for the sake of clearness, at the instant at which
the matter passes over this point. If s is the proper-time of an
elementary particle of matter then

we see that this expression

Consequently, E[∗] cannot have a surface-curl (and B cannot have
a surface-divergence).
The fundamental equations for moving bodies were deduced by
Lorentz from the theory of electrons in a form equivalent to the
above before the discovery of the principle of relativity. This is not
surprising, seeing that Maxwell’s fundamental laws for the æther
satisfy the principle of relativity, and that the theory of electrons
derives those governing the behaviour of matter by building up
mean values from these laws. Fizeau’s and Wilson’s experiments
and another analogous one, that of Röntgen and Eichwald (vide
note 11), prove that the electromagnetic behaviour of matter is
in accordance with the principle of relativity; the problems of the
electrodynamics of moving bodies first led Einstein to enunciate
it. We are indebted to Minkowski for recognising clearly that the
fundamental equations for moving bodies are determined uniquely
by the principle of relativity if Maxwell’s theory for matter at rest
is taken for granted. He it was, also, who formulated it in its final
form (vide note 12).
Our next aim will be to subjugate mechanics, which does
not obey the principle in its classical form, to the principle of
relativity of Einstein, and to inquire whether the modifications
that the latter demands can be made to harmonise with the facts

**§** **g** **p** **y**

On the theory of electrons we found the mechanical effect of
the electromagnetic field to depend on a vector p whose contravariant components are

_p[i]_ = F _[ik]sk = ρ0F_ _[ik]uk._

It therefore satisfies the equation

_p[i]ui = (p, u) = 0_ (47)

in which u is the world-direction of the matter. If we split up p
and u in any way into space and time thus


**u = h | hv** _,_
**p = λ | p,**

(48)


we get p as the force-density and, as we see from (47) or from

_h�λ −_ (p, v )� = 0

that λ is the work-density.
We arrive at the fundamental law of the mechanics which
agrees with Einstein’s Principle of Relativity by the same method
as that by which we obtain the fundamental equations of electromagnetics. We assume that Newton’s Law remains valid in
the system of reference in which the matter is at rest. We fix
our attention on the point-mass m, which is situated at a definite
world-point O and split up our quantities in terms of its worlddirection u into space and time. m is momentarily at rest in Ru.
Let µ be the density in R of the matter at the point O Sup

that (u · du) = 0. Hence, splitting up with respect to u, we get

**u = 1 | O,** _du = 0 | dv_ _,_ **p = 0 | p.**

It follows from
**u + du = 1 | dv**

that dv is the relative velocity acquired by m (in Ru) during the
time ds. Thus there can be no doubt that the fundamental law of
mechanics is
_dv_
_µ0_

_ds_ [=][ p][.]

From this we derive at once the invariant form


_du_
_µ0_ (49)

_ds_ [=][ p][,]

which is quite independent of the manner of splitting up. In it,
_µ0 is the statical density, that is, the density of the mass when at_
rest; ds is the proper-time that elapses during the infinitesimal
displacement of the particle of matter, during which its worlddirection increases by du.
Resolution into terms of u is a partition which would alter
during the motion of the particle of matter. If we now split up
our quantities, however, into space and time by means of some
fixed time-like vector e that points into the future and satisfies
the condition of normality (e, e) = −1, then, by (48), (49) resolves

the velocity of the point-masses as compared with the velocity of
light. Consequently, in the case of the small velocities with which
we usually deal in mechanics, no difference can be demonstrated
experimentally. It will become perceptible only for velocities that
approximate to that of light; in such cases the inertial resistance
of matter against the accelerating force will increase to such an
extent that the possibility of actually reaching the velocity of light
is excluded. Cathode rays and the β-radiations emitted by radioactive substances have made us familiar with free negative electrons whose velocity is comparable to that of light. Experiments
by Kaufmann, Bucherer, Ratnowsky, Hupka, and others, have
shown in actual fact that the longitudinal acceleration caused in
the electrons by an electric field or the transverse acceleration
caused by a magnetic field is just that which is demanded by the
theory of relativity. A further confirmation based on the motion
of the electrons circulating in the atom has been found recently in
the fine structure of the spectral lines emitted by the atom (vide
note 13). Only when we have added to the fundamental equations of the electron theory, which, in § 20, was brought into an
invariant form agreeing with the principle of relativity, the equation s[i] = ρ0u[i], namely, the assertion that electricity is associated
with matter, and also the fundamental equations of mechanics,
do we get a complete cycle of connected laws, in which a statement of the actual unfolding of natural phenomena is contained,
independent of all conventions of notation. Now that this final
stage has been carried out, we may at last claim to have proved
the validity of the principle of relativity for a certain region, that

In accordance with the universal meaning ascribed to the conception energy in physics, we must assume that this holds not
only for the electromagnetic field but for every region of physical
phenomena, and that it is expedient to regard this tensor instead
of the ponderomotive force as the primary quantity. Our purpose is to discover for every region of phenomena in what manner
the energy-momentum-tensor (whose components Sik must always

The Principle of the Conservation of Energy is here expressed in
its clearest form. But, according to the theory of relativity, it
is indissolubly connected with the principle of the conservation
of momentum and the conception momentum (or impulse)
**must claim just as universal a significance as that of en-**
**ergy. If we express the kinetic tensor at a world-point in terms of**
a normal co-ordinate system such that, relatively to it, the matter
itself is momentarily at rest, its components assume a particularly
simple form, namely, U00 = µ0 (or = c[2]µ0, if we use the c.g.s. system, in which c is not = 1), and all the remaining components
vanish. This suggests the idea that mass is to be regarded as
concentrated potential energy that moves on through space.

**§ 25. Mass and Energy**

To interpret the idea expressed in the preceding sentence we
shall take up the thread by returning to the consideration of the
motion of the electron. So far, we have imagined that we have to
write for the force P in its equation of motion (52) the following:

**P = e�E + [v, H]�** (e = charge of the electron)

that is, that P is composed of the impressed electric and magnetic
fields E and H Actually however the electron is subject not

difficulty arises, however, in the circumstance that we do not know
the constitution of the electron, and that we do not know the
nature and laws of the cohesive pressure that keeps the electron
together against the enormous centrifugal forces of the negative
charge compressed in it. In any case the electron at rest and
its electric field (which we consider as part of it) is a physical
system, which is in a state of statical equilibrium—and that is
the essential point. Let us choose a normal co-ordinate system in
which the electron is at rest. Suppose its energy-tensor to have
components tik. The fact that the electron is at rest is expressed
by the vanishing of the energy-flux of whose components are t0i
(i = 1, 2, 3). The 0th condition of equilibrium

_∂t[k]i_ = 0 (53)
_∂xk_

then tells us that the energy-density t00 is independent of the
time x0. On account of symmetry the components ti0 (i = 1, 2, 3)
of the momentum-density each also vanish. If t[(1)] is the vector whose components are t11, t12, t13, the condition for equilibrium (53), (i = 1), gives

div t[(1)] = 0.

Hence we have, for example,

div(x2t[(1)]) = x2 div t[(1)] + t12 = t12

and since the integral of a divergence is zero (we may assume that
the t’s vanish at infinity at least as far as to the fourth order) we
get

regard these circumstances as existing for every system in statical
equilibrium. The result obtained may be expressed by invariant
formulæ for the case of any arbitrary co-ordinate system thus:

�
_tik dV0 = E0uiuk_ (i, k = 0, 1, 2, 3). (54)

_E0 is the energy-content (measured in the space of reference for_
which the electron is at rest), ui are the co-variant components
of the world-direction of the electron, and dV0 the statical volume
of an element of space (calculated on the supposition that the
whole of space participates in the motion of the electron). (54) is
rigorously true for uniform translation. We may also apply the
formula in the case of non-uniform motion if u does not change
too suddenly in space or in time. The components

_p¯[i]_ = −[∂t][ik]

of the ponderomotive effect, exerted on the electron by itself, are
however, then no longer = 0.
If we assume the electron to be entirely without mass, and if
_p[i]_ is the “4-force” acting from without, then equilibrium demands
that
_p¯[i]_ + p[i] = 0. (55)

We split up u and p into space and time in terms of a fixed e,

material body an invariable mass m which, in consequence of the
manner in which it occurs in the fundamental law of mechanics,
represents the inertia of matter, that is, its resistance to the accelerating forces. Mechanics accepts this inertial mass as given

the potential energy contained in material bodies is the cause of
this inertia, and that the value of the mass corresponding to the

We have thus attained a new, purely dynamical view of matter.[∗] Just as the theory of relativity has taught us to reject the
belief that we can recognise one and the same point in space at different times, so now we see that there is no longer a mean**ing in speaking of the same position of matter at different**
**times. The electron, which was formerly regarded as a body of**
foreign substance in the non-material electromagnetic field, now
no longer seems to us a very small region marked off distinctly
from the field, but to be such that, for it, the field-quantities
and the electrical densities assume enormously high values. An
“energy-knot” of this type propagates itself in empty space in a
manner no different from that in which a water-wave advances over
the surface of the sea; there is no “one and the same substance” of
which the electron is composed at all times. There is only a potential; and no kinetic energy-momentum-tensor becomes added
to it. The resolution into these two, which occurs in mechanics,
is only the separation of the thinly distributed energy in the field
from that concentrated in the energy-knots, electrons and atoms;
the boundary between the two is quite indeterminate. The theory
of fields has to explain why the field is granular in structure and
why these energy-knots preserve themselves permanently from energy and momentum in their passage to and fro (although they

ing it for the primary reason that the force of cohesion holding the
electron together is wanting in it. What is commonly called
**matter is by its very nature atomic; for we do not usually**
call diffusely distributed energy matter. Atoms and electrons
**are not, of course, ultimate invariable elements, which natu-**
ral forces attack from without, pushing them hither and thither,
but they are themselves distributed continuously and subject to
minute changes of a fluid character in their smallest parts. It
is not the field that requires matter as its carrier in order to be
able to exist itself, but matter is, on the contrary, an offspring
**of the field. The formulæ that express the components of the**
energy-tensor Tik in terms of phase-quantities of the field tell us
_the laws according to which the field is associated with energy_
and momentum, that is, with matter. Since there is no sharp line
of demarcation between diffuse field-energy and that of electrons
and atoms, we must broaden our conception of matter, if it is still
to retain an exact meaning. In future we shall assign the term
matter to that real thing, which is represented by the energymomentum-tensor. In this sense, the optical field, for example, is
also associated with matter. Just as in this way matter is merged
into the field, so mechanics is expanded into physics. For the law
of conservation of matter, the fundamental law of mechanics

_∂Ti[k]_ = 0, (57)

in which the Tik’s are expressed in terms of the field-quantities,
represents a differential relationship between these quantities, and

body as warmth, and the momentum-flux as pressure. The energyflux of light on the surface of the epithelium of my eye determines
the optical sensations that I experience. Hidden behind the matter
thus revealed directly to our organs of sense there is, however, the
**field. To discover the laws governing the latter itself and also**
the laws by which it determines matter we have a first brilliant
beginning in Maxwell’s Theory, but this is not our final destination
in the quest of knowledge.[∗]

To account for the inertia of matter we must, according to formula (56), ascribe a very considerable amount of energy-content
to it: one kilogram of water is to contain 9·10[23] ergs. A small portion of this energy is energy of cohesion, that keeps the molecules
or atoms associated together in the body. Another portion is the
chemical energy that binds the atoms together in the molecule and
the sudden liberation of which we observe in an explosion (in solid
bodies this chemical energy cannot be distinguished from the energy of cohesion). Changes in the chemical constitution of bodies
or in the grouping of atoms or electrons involve the energies due
to the electric forces that bind together the negatively charged
electrons and the positive nucleus; all ionisation phenomena are
included in this category. The energy of the composite atomic
nucleus, of which a part is set free during radioactive disintegration, far exceeds the amounts mentioned above. The greater
part of this, again, consists of the intrinsic energy of the elements
of the atomic nucleus and of the electrons. We know of it only
through inertial effects as we have hitherto—owing to a merciful

**Inertial mass varies with the contained energy. If a body**
is heated, its inertial mass increases; if it is cooled, it decreases;
this effect is, of course, too small to be observed directly.
The foregoing treatment of systems in statical equilibrium, in
which we have in general followed Laue,[∗] was applied to the electron with special assumptions concerning its constitution, even
before Einstein’s discovery of the principle of relativity. The electron was assumed to be a sphere with a uniform charge either
on its surface or distributed evenly throughout its volume, and
held together by a cohesive pressure composed of forces equal
in all directions and directed towards the centre. The resultant
“electromagnetic mass” _[E][0]_

_c[2][ agrees numerically with the results of]_
observation, if one ascribes a radius of the order of magnitude
10[−][13] cms. to the electron. There is no cause for surprise at the
fact that even before the advent of the theory of relativity this
interpretation of electronic inertia was possible; for, in treating
electrodynamics after the manner of Maxwell, one was already
unconsciously treading in the steps of the principle of relativity as
far as this branch of phenomena is concerned. We are indebted to
Einstein and Planck, above all, for the enunciation of the inertia
of energy (vide note 15). Planck, in his development of dynamics,
started from a “test body” which, contrary to the electron, was
fully known although it was not in the ordinary sense material,
namely, cavity-radiation in thermodynamical equilibrium, as produced according to Kirchoff’s Law, in every cavity enclosed by
walls at the same uniform temperature.

statical density of mass µ as the density of energy in the energymomentum-tensor—referred to a co-ordinate system in which the
matter is at rest. Thus, if in hydrodynamics we limit ourselves to
adiabatic phenomena, we must set

_µ0 = µ[∗]_ _−_ _p, in addition. We then get the invariant equations_

_Ti[k]_ [=][ µ][∗][u][i][u][k][ +][ pδ]i[k][,]
or _Tik = µ[∗]uiuk + p · gik._ (58)

The statical density of mass is

_Tiku[i]u[k]_ = µ[∗] _−_ _p = µ0_

the case of incompressible fluids. If no forces act on the fluid, the

for the theory of elasticity based on the principle of relativity
(vide note 16). There still remains the task of making the law
of gravitation, which, in Newton’s form, is entirely bound to the
principle of relativity of Newton and Galilei, conform to that of
Einstein. This, however, involves special problems of its own to
which we shall return in the last chapter.

**§ 26. Mie’s Theory**

The theory of Maxwell and Lorentz cannot hold for the interior
of the electron; therefore, from the point of view of the ordinary
theory of electrons we must treat the electron as something given
_a priori, as a foreign body in the field. A more general theory_
of electrodynamics has been proposed by Mie, by which it seems
possible to derive the matter from the field (vide note 17). We
shall sketch its outlines briefly here—as an example of a physical
theory fully conforming with the new ideas of matter, and one
that will be of good service later. It will give us an opportunity
of formulating the problem of matter a little more clearly.
We shall retain the view that the following phase-quantities are
of account: (1) the four-dimensional current-vector s, the “electricity”; (2) the linear tensor of the second order F, the “field”.
Their properties are expressed in the equations

_∂s[i]_
(1) = 0,

_∂xi_

_∂Fkl_
(2) + _[∂F][li]_ + _[∂F][ik]_ = 0.

_∂xi_ _∂xk_ _∂xl_


-----

(3) _Fik =_ _[∂φ][i]_ _−_ _[∂φ][k]_ _._

_∂xk_ _∂xi_

Conversely, it follows from (2) that a vector φ must exist such that
equations (3) hold. In the same way (1) is fulfilled if s is derivable
from a skew-symmetrical tensor H of the second order according
to

(4) _s[i]_ = _[∂H]_ _[ik]_ _._

_∂xk_

Conversely, it follows from (1) that a tensor H satisfying these
conditions must exist. Lorentz assumed generally, not only for
the æther, but also for the domain of electrons, that H = F .
Following Mie, we shall make the more general assumption that
_H is not a mere number of calculation but has a real significance,_
and that its components are, therefore, universal functions of the
primary phase-quantities s and F . To be logical we must then
make the same assumption about φ. The resultant scheme of
quantities
_φ_ _F_
_s_ _H_

contains the quantities of intensity in the first row; they are connected with one another by the differential equations (3). In the
second row we have the quantities of magnitude, for which the
differential quantities (4) hold. If we perform the resolution into
space and time and use the same terms as in § 20 we arrive at the
well-known equations


_dρ_
(1) = 0,

_dt_ [+ div][ s]


-----

(3)
_dt_ [+ grad][ φ][ =][ E][ (][−] [curl][ f][ =][ B][)][,]

_dD_
(4) _dt_ _[−]_ [curl][ H][ =][ −][s] (div D = ρ).


If we know the universal functions, which express φ and H in terms
of s and F, then, excluding the equations in brackets, and counting
each component separately, we have ten “principal equations” before us, in which the derivatives of the ten phase-quantities with
respect to the time are expressed in relation to themselves and
their spatial derivatives; that is, we have physical laws in the form
that is demanded by the principle of causality. The principle
of relativity that here appears as an antithesis, in a certain sense,
to the principle of causality, demands that the principal equations
be accompanied by the bracketed “subsidiary equations,” in which
no time derivatives occur. The conflict is avoided by noticing that
the subsidiary equations are superfluous. For it follows from the
principal equations (2) and (3) that

_∂_
_∂t[(][B][ + curl][ f]_ [) =][ 0][,]

and from (1) and (4) that

_∂ρ_ _[∂]_

_∂t_ [=] _∂t[(div][ D][)][.]_


It is instructive to compare Mie’s Theory with Lorentz’s fundamental equations of the theory of electrons. In the latter, (1), (2),
and (4) occur, whilst the law by which H is determined from the
primary phase-quantities is simply expressed by D = E, H = B.
On the other hand in Mie’s theory φ and f are defined in (3)

of the field and on the electricity. In place of this we find the
formula giving the density of the mechanical force and the law of
mechanics, which governs the motion of electrons under the influence of this force. Since, however, according to the new view
which we have put forward, the mechanical law must follow from
the field-equations, an addendum becomes necessary; for this purpose, Mie makes the assumption that φ and f acquire a physical
meaning in the sense indicated. We may, however, enunciate Mie’s
equation (3) in a form fully analogous to that of the fundamental
law of mechanics. We contrast the ponderomotive force occurring
in it with the “electrical force” E in this case. In the statical case
(3) states that
_E −_ grad φ = 0, (59)

that is, the electric force E is counterbalanced in the æther by an
“electrical pressure” φ. In general, however, a resulting electrical force arises which, by (3), now belongs to the magnitude f as
the “electrical momentum”. It inspires us with wonder to see
how, in Mie’s Theory, the fundamental equation of electrostatics (59) which stands at the commencement of electrical theory,
suddenly acquires a much more vivid meaning by the appearance
of potential as an electrical pressure; this is the required cohesive
pressure that keeps the electron together.
The foregoing presents only an empty scheme that has to be
filled in by the yet unknown universal functions that connect the
quantities of magnitude with those of intensity. Up to a certain
degree they may be determined purely speculatively by means of
the postulate that the theorem of conservation (57) must hold for
the energy momentum tensor T (that is that the principle of


-----

p p
The energy-law must be of the form

_∂W_

_∂t_ [+ div][ s][ = 0]

in which W is the density of energy, and s the energy-flux. We
get at Maxwell’s Theory by multiplying (2) by H and (4) by E,
and then adding, which gives


_H_ _[∂][B]_ _[∂][D]_ (60)

_∂t_ [+][ E] _∂t_ [+ div[][E] _[,][ H][] =][ −][(][E]_ _[,][ s][)][.]_

In this relation (60) we have also on the right, the work, which is
used in increasing the kinetic energy of the electrons or, according
to our present view, in increasing the potential energy of the field
of electrons. Hence this term must also be composed of a term
differentiated with respect to the time, and of a divergence. If we
now treat equations (1) and (3) in the same way as we just above
treated (2) and (4), that is, multiply (1) by φ and (3) scalarly
by s, we get

_φ_ _[∂ρ]_ _[∂f]_ (61)

_∂t_ [+][ s] _∂t_ [+ div(][φ][s][) = (][E] _[,][ s][)][.]_

(60) and (61) together give the energy theorem; accordingly the
energy-flux must be
_S = [E_ _, H] + φs,_

and
_φ δρ + s δf + H δB + E δD = δW_

is the total differential of the energy-density. It is easy to see
why a term proportional to s namely φs has to be added to the


-----

g, gy
also. In the æther the term (E _, H) is overpowered by S, but in the_
electron the other φs easily gains the upper hand. The quantities
_ρ, f_, B, D occur in the formula for the total differential of the
energy-density as independent differentiated phase-quantities. For
the sake of clearness we shall introduce φ and E as independent
variables in place of ρ and D. By this means all the quantities
of intensity are made to act as independent variables. We must
build up
_L = W −_ _ED −_ _ρφ,_ (62)

and then we get

_δL = (H δB −_ _D δE_ ) + (s δf − _ρ δφ)._

If L is known as a function of the quantities of intensity, then these
equations express the quantities of magnitude as functions of the
quantities of intensity. In place of the ten unknown universal
**functions we have now only one, L; this is accomplished by**
the principle of energy.
Let us again return to four-dimensional notation, we then have

_δL =_ [1] (63)

2 _[H]_ _[ik][ δF][ik][ +][ s][i][ δφ][i][.]_

From this it follows that δL, and hence L, the “Hamiltonian
**Function” is an invariant. The simplest invariants that may be**
formed from a vector having components φi and a linear tensor
of the second order having components Fik are the squares of the
following expressions:

the vector φ[i], _φiφ[i],_


-----

p _ik_ _lm_
(the summation extends over the 24 permutations of the indices
_i, k, l, m; the upper sign applies to the even permutations, the_
lower ones to the odd); and finally of the vector Fikφ[k].
Just as in three-dimensional geometry the most important theorem of congruence is that a vector-pair a, b is fully characterised
in respect to congruence by means of the invariants a[2], ab, b[2],
so it may be shown in four-dimensional geometry that the invariants quoted determine fully in respect to congruence the figure
composed of a vector φ and a linear tensor of the second order F .
Every invariant, in particular the Hamiltonian Function L, must
therefore be expressible algebraically in terms of the above four
quantities. Mie’s Theory thus resolves the problem of matter into
a determination of this expression. Maxwell’s Theory of the æther
which, of course, precludes the possibility of electrons, is contained
in it as the special case L = L[0]. If we also express W and the
components of S in terms of four-dimensional quantities, we see
that they are the negative (0th) row in the scheme

_Ti[k]_ [=][ F][ir][H] _[kr][ +][ φ][i][s][k][ −]_ _[L][ ·][ δ]i[k][.]_ (64)

The Ti[k][’s are thus the mixed components of the energy-momentum-]
tensor, which, according to our calculations, fulfil the theorem
of conservation (57) for i = 0 and hence also for i = 1, 2, 3.
In the next chapter we shall add the proof that its co-variant
components satisfy the condition of symmetry Tki = Tik.
The laws for the field may be summarised in a very simple
principle of variation, Hamilton’s Principle. For this we regard
only the potential with components φi as an independent phase

Hamilton’s invariant function L which depends on the potential
and the field enters into these laws. We define the current-vector s
and the skew-symmetrical tensor H by means of (63). If in an
arbitrary linear co-ordinate system

_dω =_ _[√]g dx0 dx1 dx2 dx3_

is the four-dimensional “volume-element” of the world (−g is the

�
determinant of the metrical groundform) then the integral _L dω_

taken over any region of the world is an invariant. It is called the
**Action contained in the region in question. Hamilton’s Principle**
states that the change in the total Action for each infinitesimal
variation of the state of the field, which vanishes outside a finite
region, is zero, that is,

� �
_δ_ _L dω =_ _δL dω = 0._ (65)

This integral is to be taken over the whole world or, what comes
to the same thing, over a finite region beyond which the variation of the phase vanishes. This variation is represented by the
infinitesimal increments δφi of the potential-components and the
accompanying infinitesimal change of the field

get

By the principle of partial integration (vide page 165) we get

and, accordingly,

Whereas (3) is given by definition, we see that Hamilton’s Principle furnishes the field-equations (4). In point of fact, if, for
instance,

_s −_ _[∂H]_ _[ik]_ _̸= 0_

but is > 0 at a certain point, then we could mark off a small region
encircling this point, such that, for it, this difference is positive
throughout. If we then choose a non-negative function for δφ1
that vanishes outside the region marked off, and if δφ2 = δφ3 =
_δφ4 = 0, we arrive at a contradiction to equation (65)—(1) and (2)_
follow from (3) and (4).
We find, then, that Mie’s Electrodynamics exists in a

chanical system and has to be deduced from the constitution of
the system, we are here concerned with a single system, the world.
This is where the real problem of matter takes its beginning: we
have to determine the “function of action,” the world-function L,
belonging to the world. For the present it leaves us in perplexity.
If we choose an arbitrary L, we get a “possible” world governed
by this function of action, which will be perfectly intelligible to
us—more so than the actual world—provided that our mathematical analysis does not fail us. We are, of course, then concerned in
discovering the only existing world, the real world for us. Judging
from what we know of physical laws, we may expect the L which
belongs to it to be distinguished by having simple mathematical
properties. Physics, this time as a physics of fields, is again pursuing the object of reducing the totality of natural phenomena to
**a single physical law: it was believed that this goal was almost**
within reach once before when Newton’s Principia, founded on the
physics of mechanical point-masses was celebrating its triumphs.
But the treasures of knowledge are not like ripe fruits that may
be plucked from a tree.
For the present we do not yet know whether the phasequantities on which Mie’s Theory is founded will suffice to describe matter or whether matter is purely “electrical” in nature.
Above all, the ominous clouds of those phenomena that we are
with varying success seeking to explain by means of the quantum
of action, are throwing their shadows over the sphere of physical
knowledge, threatening no one knows what new revolution.
Let us try the following hypothesis for L:


-----

( y ); gg
being the simplest of those that go beyond Maxwell’s Theory. We
have no grounds for assuming that the world-function has actually
this form. We shall confine ourselves to a consideration of statical
solutions, for which we have

_B = H = 0,_ _s = f = 0,_
_E = grad φ,_ div D = ρ,
_D = E_ _,_ _ρ = −w[′](φ)_

(the accent denoting the derivative). In comparison with the ordinary electrostatics of the æther we have here the new circumstance that the density ρ is a universal function of the potential,
the electrical pressure φ. We get for Poisson’s equation

∆φ + w[′](φ) = 0. (68)

If w(φ) is not an even function of φ, this equation no longer holds
after the transition from φ to −φ; this would account for the
**difference between the natures of positive and negative**
**electricity. Yet it certainly leads to a remarkable difficulty in**
the case of non-statical fields. If charges having opposite signs
are to occur in the latter, the root in (67) must have different
signs at different points of the field. Hence there must be points
in the field, for which φiφ[i] vanishes. In the neighbourhood of
such a point φiφ[i] must be able to assume positive and negative
values (this does not follow in the statical case, as the minimum
of the function φ[2]0 [for][ φ][0] [is zero).] The solutions of our fieldequations must, therefore, become imaginary at regular distances
apart It would be difficult to interpret a degeneration of the field


-----

which the field becomes imaginary.
A solution (vanishing at infinity) of equation (68) represents
a possible state of electrical equilibrium, or a possible corpuscle
capable of existing individually in the world that we now proceed
to construct. The equilibrium can be stable, only if the solution is
radially symmetrical. In this case, if r denotes the radius vector,
the equation becomes


�
+ w[′](φ) = 0. (69)

If (69) is to have a regular solution

_−φ =_ _[e][0]_ _[e][1]_ (70)

_r_ [+] _r[2][ +][ . . .]_


at r = ∞, we find by substituting this power series for the first
term of the equation that the series for w[′](φ) begins with the
power r[−][4] or one with a still higher negative index, and hence
that w(x) must be a zero of at least the fifth order for x = 0.
On this assumption the equations must have a single infinity of
regular solutions at r = 0 and also a single infinity of regular solutions at r = ∞. We may (in the “general” case) expect these
two one-dimensional families of solutions (included in the twodimensional complete family of all the solutions) to have a finite
or, at any rate, a discrete number of solutions. These would represent the various possible corpuscles. (Electrons and elements of
the atomic nucleus?) One electron or one atomic nucleus does
not, of course, exist alone in the world; but the distances between
them are so great in comparison with their own size that they do

_These physical laws, then, enable us to calculate the mass_

have always accepted these ultimate constituents of matter as
things given with their numerical properties. All this, of course, is
merely a suggested plan of action as long as the world-function L
is not known. The special hypothesis (67) from which we just
now started was assumed only to show what a deep and thorough
knowledge of matter and its constituents as based on laws would
be exposed to our gaze if we could but discover the action-function.
For the rest, the discussion of such arbitrarily chosen hypotheses
cannot lead to any proper progress; new physical knowledge and
principles will be required to show us the right way to determine

of action (65) holding in it will be contrasted with that by which
the theory of Maxwell and Lorentz is governed; the latter theory
recognises, besides the electromagnetic field, a substance moving
in it. This substance is a three-dimensional continuum; hence its
parts may be referred in a continuous manner to the system of
values of three co-ordinates α, β, γ. Let us imagine the substance
divided up into infinitesimal elements. Every element of substance
has then a definite invariable positive mass dm and an invariable
electrical charge de. As an expression of its history there corresponds to it then a world-line with a definite direction of traverse
or, in better words, an infinitely thin “world-filament”. If we again
divide this up into small portions, and if

_ds =_ �−gik dxi dxk

is the proper-time length of such a portion, then we may introduce
the space-time function µ0 of the statical mass-density by means

substance-density ν of the mass thus:

(ν behaves as a scalar-density for arbitrary transformations of the
substance co-ordinates α, β, γ). On each world-line of a substancepoint α, β, γ we reckon the proper-time s from a definite initial
point (which must, of course, vary continuously from substancepoint to substance-point). The co-ordinates xi of the world-point
at which the substance-point α, β, γ happens to be at the moment s of its motion (after the proper-time s has elapsed), are then
continuous functions of α, β, γ, s, whose functional determinant

If we likewise perform variation on the substance-action of the

This completes the cycle of laws which were mentioned on
page 297. This theory does not, of course, explain the existence of the electron, since the cohesive forces are lacking in
it.
A striking feature of the principle of action just formulated
is that a field-action does not associate itself with the substanceaction of the mass, as happens in the case of electricity. This gap
will be filled in the next chapter, in which it will be shown that the
**gravitational field is what corresponds to mass in the same way**
as the electromagnetic field corresponds to the electrical charge.

The great advance in our knowledge described in this chapter consists in recognising that the scene of action of reality
is not a three-dimensional Euclidean space but rather a four**dimensional world, in which space and time are linked**
**together indissolubly. However deep the chasm may be that**


-----

p, g q
objective world which physics endeavours to crystallise out of
direct experience. It is a four-dimensional continuum, which is
neither “time” nor “space”. Only the consciousness that passes on
in one portion of this world experiences the detached piece which
comes to meet it and passes behind it, as history, that is, as a
process that is going forward in time and takes place in space.
This four-dimensional space is metrical like Euclidean space,
but the quadratic form which determines its metrical structure
is not definitely positive, but has one negative dimension. This
circumstance is certainly of no mathematical importance, but has
a deep significance for reality and the relationship of its action. It
was necessary to grasp the idea of the metrical four-dimensional
world, which is so simple from the mathematical point of view,
not only in isolated abstraction but also to pursue the weightiest
inferences that can be drawn from it towards setting up the view
of physical phenomena, so that we might arrive at a proper understanding of its content and the range of its influence: that was
what we aimed to do in a short account. It is remarkable that
the three-dimensional geometry of the statical world that was put
into a complete axiomatic system by Euclid has such a translucent
character, whereas we have been able to assume command over
the four-dimensional geometry only after a prolonged struggle and
by referring to an extensive set of physical phenomena and empirical data. Only now the theory of relativity has succeeded in
enabling our knowledge of physical nature to get a full grasp of
the fact of motion, of change in the world.

THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

**§ 27. The Relativity of Motion, Metrical Fields,**
**Gravitation[∗]**

However successfully the Principle of Relativity of Einstein
worked out in the preceding chapter marshals the physical laws
which are derived from experience and which define the relationship of action in the world, we cannot express ourselves as satisfied
from the point of view of the theory of knowledge. Let us again
revert to the beginning of the foregoing chapter. There we were introduced to a “kinematical” principle of relativity; x1, x2, x3, t were
the space-time co-ordinates of a world-point referred to a definite
permanent Cartesian co-ordinate system in space; x[′]1[,][ x][′]2[,][ x][′]3[,][ t][′]

were the co-ordinates of the same point relative to a second such
system, that may be moving arbitrarily with respect to the first;
they are connected by the transformation formulæ (II), page 225.
It was made quite clear that two series of physical states or phases
cannot be distinguished from one another in an objective manner,
if the phase-quantities of the one are represented by the same
mathematical functions of x[′]1[,][ x][′]2[,][ x][′]3[,][ t][′][ as those that describe the]
first series in terms of the arguments x1, x2, x3, t. Hence the
physical laws must have exactly the same form in the one system
of independent space-time arguments as in the other. It must certainly be admitted that the facts of dynamics are apparently in
direct contradiction to Einstein’s postulate, and it is just these
facts that, since the time of Newton, have forced us to attribute
an absolute meaning, not to translation, but to rotation. Yet our

thrust on them by reality (in spite of all the attempts that have
been made by philosophers to justify it, as, for example, Kant’s
_Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaften), and the_
problem of centrifugal force has always been felt to be an unsolved
enigma (vide note 2).
Where do the centrifugal and other inertial forces take their
origin? Newton’s answer was: in absolute space. The answer
given by the special theory of relativity does not differ essentially
from that of Newton. It recognises as the source of these forces
the metrical structure of the world and considers this structure as
a formal property of the world. But that which expresses itself as
force must itself be real. We can, however, recognise the metrical
structure as something real, if it is itself capable of undergoing
changes and reacts in response to matter. Hence our only way out
of the dilemma—and this way, too, was opened up by Einstein—
is to apply Riemann’s ideas, as set forth in Chapter II, to the
four-dimensional Einstein-Minkowski world which was treated in
Chapter III instead of to three-dimensional Euclidean space. In
doing this we shall not for the present make use of the most general
conception of the metrical manifold, but shall retain Riemann’s
view. According to this, we must assume the world-points to form
a four-dimensional manifold, on which a measure-determination
is impressed by a non-degenerate quadratic differential form Q
having one positive and three negative dimensions.[∗] In any co
_∗We have made a change in the notation, as compared with that of the_
preceding chapter, by placing reversed signs before the metrical groundform.
The former convention was more convenient for representing the splitting up
of the world into space and time, the present one is found more expedient in

Physical laws will then be expressed by tensor relations that are
invariant for arbitrary continuous transformations of the arguments xi. In them the co-efficients gik of the quadratic differential form (1) will occur in conjunction with the other physical
phase-quantities. Hence we shall satisfy the postulate of relativity enunciated above, without violating the facts of experience,
**if we regard the gik’s in exactly the same way as we regarded**
the components φi of the electromagnetic potential (which are
formed by the co-efficients of an invariant linear differential form
� _φi dxi), as physical phase-quantities, to which there cor-_
**responds something real, namely, the “metrical field”. Un-**
der these circumstances invariance exists not only with respect to
the transformations mentioned (II), which have a fully arbitrary
(non-linear) character only for the time-co-ordinate, but for any
transformations whatsoever. This special distinction conferred on
the time-co-ordinate by (II), is, indeed, incompatible with the
knowledge gained from Einstein’s Principle of Relativity. By allowing any arbitrary transformations in place of (II), that is, also
such as are non-linear with respect to the space-co-ordinates, we
affirm that Cartesian co-ordinate systems are in no wise more
favoured than any “curvilinear” co-ordinate system. This seals
**the doom of the idea that a geometry may exist inde-**
**pendently of physics in the traditional sense, and it is just**
because we had not emancipated ourselves from the dogma that
such a geometry existed that we arrived by logical considerations

ordinates. Actually, however, spatial measurement is based on a
physical event: the reaction of light-rays and rigid measuring rods
on our whole physical world. We have already encountered this
view in § 21, but we may, above all, take up the thread from our
discussion in § 12, for we have, indeed, here arrived at Riemann’s
“dynamical” view as a necessary consequence of the relativity of
all motion. The behaviour of light-rays and measuring rods, besides being determined by their own natures, is also conditioned
by the “metrical field,” just as the behaviour of an electric charge
depends not only on it, itself, but also on the electric field. Again,
just as the electric field, for its part, depends on the charges and
is instrumental in producing a mechanical interaction between the
charges, so we must assume here that the metrical field (or, in
mathematical language, the tensor with components gik) is re**lated to the material content filling the world. We again**
call attention to the principle of action set forth at the conclusion
of the preceding paragraph; in both of the parts which refer to
substance, the metrical field takes up the same position towards
mass as the electrical field does towards the electric charge. The
assumption, which was made in the preceding chapter, concerning
the metrical structure of the world (corresponding to that of Euclidean geometry in three-dimensional space), namely, that there
are specially favoured co-ordinate systems, “linear” ones, in which
the metrical groundform has constant co-efficients, can no longer
be maintained in the face of this view.
A simple illustration will suffice to show how geometrical conditions are involved when motion takes place. Let us set a plane
disc spinning uniformly. I affirm that if we consider Euclidean

itself, if the latter be measured by means of measuring rods moving with it. For let us consider a circle on the disc described with
its centre at the centre of rotation. Its radius remains the same
no matter whether the measuring rods with which I measure it
are at rest or not, since its direction of motion is perpendicular
to the measuring rod when in the position required for measuring
the radius, that is, along its length. On the other hand, I get a
value greater for the circumference of the circle than that obtained
when the disc is at rest when I apply the measuring rods, owing
to the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction which the latter undergoes.
The Euclidean theorem which states that the circumference of the
circle = 2π times the radius thus no longer holds on the disc when
it rotates.
The falling over of glasses in a dining-car that is passing round
a sharp curve and the bursting of a fly-wheel in rapid rotation are
not, according to the view just expressed, effects of “an absolute
rotation” as Newton would state but whose existence we deny;
they are effects of the “metrical field” or rather of the affine relationship associated with it. Galilei’s principle of inertia shows that
there is a sort of “forcible guidance” which compels a body that is
projected with a definite velocity to move in a definite way which
can be altered only by external forces. This “guiding field,” which
is physically real, was called “affine relationship” above. When a
body is diverted by external forces the guidance by forces such
as centrifugal reaction asserts itself. In so far as the state of the
guiding field does not persist, and the present one has emerged
from the past ones under the influence of the masses existing in
the world, namely, the fixed stars, the phenomena cited above are

Following Einstein by starting from the special theory of relativity described in the preceding chapter, we may arrive at the
general theory of relativity in two successive stages.
I. In conformity with the principle of continuity we take the
same step in the four-dimensional world that, in Chapter II,
brought us from Euclidean geometry to Riemann’s geometry.
This causes a quadratic differential form (1) to appear. There
is no difficulty in adapting the physical laws to this generalisation. It is expedient to represent the magnitude quantities by
tensor-densities instead of by tensors as in Chapter III; we can do
this by multiplying throughout by _[√]g (in which g is the negative_
determinant of the gik’s). Thus, in particular, the mass- and
charge-densities µ and ρ, instead of being given by formula (71)
of § 26, will be given by

_dm ds = µ dx,_ _de ds = ρ dx_ (dx = dx0 dx1 dx2 dx3).

The proper time ds along the world-line is determined from

_ds[2]_ = gik dxi dxk.

_∗We say “partly” because the distribution of matter in the world does not_
define the “guiding field” uniquely, for both are at one moment independent of one another and accidental (analogously to charge and electric field).
Physical laws tell us merely how, when such an initial state is given, all other
states (past and future) necessarily arise from them. At least, this is how
we must judge, if we are to maintain the standpoint of pure physics of fields.
The statement that the world in the form we perceive it taken as a whole is
stationary (i.e. at rest) can be interpreted, if it is to have a meaning at all,
as signifying that it is in statistical equilibrium. Cf. § 34.

forces and Coriolis forces. If we compare formula (4) for the
“pseudo-force” arising from the metrical field with that for the
mechanical force of the electromagnetic field, we find them fully
analogous. For just as the vector-density with the contra-variant
components s[i] characterises electricity so, as we shall presently
see, moving matter is described by the tensor-density which has

correspond as components of the metrical field to the components Fik of the electric field. Just as the field-components F are
derived by differentiation from the electromagnetic potential φi,
so also the Γ’s from the gik’s; these thus constitute the potential of
the metrical field. The force-density is the product of the electric
field and electricity on the one hand, and of the metrical field and
matter on the other, thus

**pi = −Fiks[k],** **p¯** _i = Γ[α]iβ[T][β]α[.]_

These formulæ were found to be expedient in the special theory
of relativity when we used curvilinear co-ordinate systems, or such
as move curvilinearly or with acceleration. To make clear the
simple meaning of these considerations we shall use this method
to determine the centrifugal force that asserts itself in a rotating
system of reference. If we use a normal co-ordinate system for the
world, namely, t, x1, x2, x3, but introduce r, z, θ, in place of the
Cartesian space co-ordinates, we get

_ds[2]_ = dt[2] _−_ (dz[2] + dr[2] + r[2] _dθ[2])._

Using ω to denote a constant angular velocity, we make the substitution
_θ = θ[′]_ + ωt[′], _t = t[′]_

and, after the substitution, drop the accents. We then get

_ds[2]_ = dt[2](1 − _r[2]ω[2]) −_ 2r[2]ω dθ dt − (dz[2] + dr[2] + r[2] _dθ[2])._

If we now put

_u[1]_ = u[2] = u[3] = 0; and hence (u[0])[2](1 − _r[2]ω[2]) = 1._

The components of the centrifugal force satisfy formula (4)

**p¯** _i =_ 2[1] _∂g∂x00i_ _· µ(u[0])[2]_


and since the derivatives with respect to x0, x1, x2 of g00, which

indicative ones t, θ, z, r, we obtain

Two closely related circumstances characterise the “pseudoforces” of the metrical field. Firstly, the acceleration which they
impart to a point-mass situated at a definite space-time point (or,
more exactly, one passing through this point with a definite velocity) is independent of its mass, i.e. the force itself is proportional
to the inertial mass of the point-mass at which it acts. Secondly,
if we use an appropriate co ordinate system namely a geodetic


-----

can be effected simultaneously for all space-time points by the introduction of a linear co-ordinate system, but in the general case
it is possible to make the whole 40 components Γ[α]iβ [of the affine]
relationship vanish at least for each individual point by choosing
an appropriate co-ordinate system at this point.[∗]

Now the two related circumstances just mentioned are true, as
we know, of the force of gravitation. The fact that a given gravitational field imparts the same acceleration to every mass that is
brought into the field constitutes the real essence of the problem of
gravitation. In the electrostatic field a slightly charged particle is
acted on by the force e _·_ **E, the electric charge e depending only on**
the particle, and E, the electric intensity of field, depending only
on the field. If no other forces are acting, this force imparts to the
particle whose inertial mass is m an acceleration which is given by
the fundamental equation of mechanics mb = eE. There is something fully analogous to this in the gravitational field. The force
that acts on the particle is equal to gG, in which g, the “gravitational charge,” depends only on the particle, whereas G depends
only on the field: the acceleration is determined here again by
the equation mb = gG. The curious fact now manifests itself
that the “gravitational charge” or the “gravitational mass” g
**is equal to the “inertial mass” m. Eötvös has comparatively**
recently tested the accuracy of this law by actual experiments of
the greatest refinement (vide note 3). The centrifugal force imparted to a body at the earth’s surface by the earth’s rotation
is proportional to its inertial mass but its weight is proportional

_∗Hence we see that it is in the nature of the metrical field that it cannot_
be described b a field tensor Γ hich is in ariant ith respect to arbitrar


-----

g, _pp_
_ent weight, would have different directions for different bodies if_
gravitational and inertial mass were not proportional throughout.
The absence of this difference of direction was demonstrated by
Eötvös by means of the exceedingly sensitive instrument known
as the torsion-balance: it enables the inertial mass of a body to
be measured to the same degree of accuracy as that to which its
weight may be determined by the most sensitive balance. The
proportionality between gravitational and inertial mass holds in
cases, too, in which a diminution of mass is occasioned not by
an escape of substance in the old sense, but by an emission of
radioactive energy.
The inertial mass of a body has, according to the fundamental
law of mechanics, a universal significance. It is the inertial mass
that regulates the behaviour of the body under the influence of
any forces acting on it, of whatever physical nature they may be;
the inertial mass of the body is, however, according to the usual
view associated only with a special physical field of force, namely,
that of gravitation. From this point of view, however, the identity
between inertial and gravitational mass remains fully incomprehensible. Due account can be taken of it only by a mechanics
which from the outset takes into consideration gravitational as
well as inertial mass. This occurs in the case of the mechanics
given by the general theory of relativity, in which we assume that
**gravitation, just like centrifugal and Coriolis forces, is in-**
**cluded in the “pseudo-force” which has its origin in the**
**metrical field. We shall find actually that the planets pursue**
the courses mapped out for them by the guiding field, and that
we need not have recourse to a special “force of gravitation,” as


-----

p p y p (
first law of motion). The gravitational forces satisfy the second
postulate also; that is, they may be made to vanish at a space-time
point if we introduce an appropriate co-ordinate system. A closed
box, such as a lift, whose suspension wire has snapped, and which
descends without friction in the gravitational field of the earth, is
a striking example of such a system of reference. All bodies that
are falling freely will appear to be at rest to an observer in the
box, and physical events will happen in the box in just the same
way as if the box were at rest and there were no gravitational
field, in spite of the fact that the gravitational force is acting.
II. The transition from the special to the general theory of
relativity, as described in I, is a purely mathematical process. By
introducing the metrical groundform (1), we may formulate physical laws so that they remain invariant for arbitrary transformations; this is a possibility that is purely mathematical in essence
and denotes no particular peculiarity of these laws. A new physical
factor appears only when it is assumed that the metrical structure
of the world is not given a priori, but that the above quadratic
form is related to matter by generally invariant laws. Only this
fact justifies us in assigning the name “general theory of relativity”
to our reasoning; we are not simply giving it to a theory which
has merely borrowed the mathematical form of relativity. The
same fact is indispensable if we wish to solve the problem of the
relativity of motion; it also enables us to complete the analogy
mentioned in I, according to which the metrical field is related to
matter in the same way as the electric field to electricity. Only if
we accept this fact does the theory briefly quoted at the end of
the previous section become possible, according to which gravi

accordance with Newton’s law of attraction) by the distribution
of matter. This assumption, rather than the postulate of general
invariance, seems to the author to be the real pivot of the general
theory of relativity. If we adopt this standpoint we are no longer
justified in calling the forces that have their origin in the metrical
field pseudo-forces. They then have just as real a meaning as the
mechanical forces of the electromagnetic field. Coriolis or centrifugal forces are real force effects, which the gravitational or guiding
field exerts on matter. Whereas, in I, we were confronted with the
easy problem of extending known physical laws (such as Maxwell’s
equations) from the special case of a constant metrical fundamental tensor to the general case, we have, in following the ideas set
out just above, to discover the invariant law of gravitation, ac**cording to which matter determines the components Γ[α]βi**
**of the gravitational field, and which replaces the Newtonian**
law of attraction in Einstein’s Theory. The well-known laws of the
field do not furnish a starting-point for this. Nevertheless Einstein
succeeded in solving this problem in a convincing fashion, and in
showing that the course of planetary motions may be explained
just as well by the new law as by the old one of Newton; indeed,
that the only discrepancy which the planetary system discloses
towards Newton’s Theory, and which has hitherto remained inexplicable, namely, the gradual advance of Mercury’s perihelion by
43[′′] per century, is accounted for accurately by Einstein’s theory
of gravitation.
Thus this theory, which is one of the greatest examples of
the power of speculative thought, presents a solution not only
of the problem of the relativity of all motion (the only solution

to those in Chapter II bring the ideas of Riemann and Einstein
to a successful issue. It may also be asserted that their point
of view is the first to give due importance to the circumstance
that space and time, in contrast with the material content of the
world, are forms of phenomena. Only physical phase-quantities
can be measured, that is, read off from the behaviour of matter in
motion; but we cannot measure the four world-co-ordinates that
we assign a priori arbitrarily to the world-points so as to be able to
represent the phase-quantities extending throughout the world by
means of mathematical functions (of four independent variables).
Whereas the potential of the electromagnetic field is built up
from the co-efficients of an invariant linear differential form of the
world-co-ordinates φi dxi, the potential of the gravitational field is
made up of the co-efficients of an invariant quadratic differential
form. This fact, which is of fundamental importance, constitutes
the form of Pythagoras’ Theorem to which it has gradually
been transformed by the stages outlined above. It does not actually spring from the observation of gravitational phenomena in
the true sense (Newton accounted for these observations by introducing a single gravitational potential), but from geometry, from
the observations of measurement. Einstein’s theory of gravitation
is the result of the fusion of two realms of knowledge which have
hitherto been developed fully independently of one another; this
synthesis may be indicated by the scheme

relativity. Let the world-points be referred to any co-ordinates xi

split up into two classes; (a) those with a space-like direction,
(b) those with a time-like direction (C < 0 or C > 0 respectively). The latter fill a “double” cone with the common vertex
at O and which, at O, separates into two simple cones, of which
one opens into the future and the other into the past. The first
comprises all world-points that belong to the “active future” of O,
the second all world-points that constitute the “passive past” of O.
The limiting sheet of the cone is formed by the geodetic null-lines
(C = 0); the “future” half of the sheet contains all the world-points
at which a light-signal emitted from O arrives, or, more generally,
the exact initial points of every effect emanating from O. The metrical groundform thus determines in general what world-points
are related to one another in effects. If dxi are the relative coordinates of a point O[′] infinitely near O, then O[′] will be traversed
by a light-signal emitted from O if, and only if, gik dxi dxk = 0.
By observing the arrival of light at the points neighbouring to O
we can thus determine the ratios of the values of the gik’s at the
point O; and, as for O, so for any other point. It is impossible,
however, to derive any further results from the phenomenon of
the propagation of light for it follows from a remark on page 188

The optical “direction” picture that an observer (“point-eye” as
on page 146) receives, for instance, from the stars in the heavens,
is to be constructed as follows. From the world-point O at which
the observer is stationed those geodetic null-lines (light-lines) are
to be drawn on the backward cone which cuts the world-lines of
the stars. The direction of every light-line at O is to be resolved
into one component which lies along the direction e of the worldline of the observer and another s which is perpendicular to it
(the meaning of perpendicular is defined by the metrical structure
of the world as given on page 180); s is the spatial direction of
the light-ray. Within the three-dimensional linear manifold of
the line-elements at O perpendicular to e, −ds[2] is a definitely
positive form. The angles (that arise from it when it is taken
as the metrical groundform, and which are to be calculated from
formula (15), § 11) between the spatial directions s of the light-rays
are those that determine the positions of the stars as perceived by
the observer.
The factor of proportionality of the gik’s which could not be
derived from the phenomenon of the transmission of light may be
determined from the motion of point-masses which carry a clock
with them. For if we assume that—at least for unaccelerated
motion under no forces—the time read off from such a clock is
the proper-time s, equation (9) clearly makes it possible to apply the unit of measure along the world-line of the motion (cf.
Appendix I).

**§**

According to the Newtonian Theory the condition (or phase)
of matter is characterised by a scalar, the mass-density µ; and
the gravitational potential is also a scalar Φ: Poisson’s equation
holds, that is,
∆Φ = 4πkµ (10)

(∆= div grad; k = the gravitational constant). This is the law
according to which matter determines the gravitational field. But
according to the theory of relativity matter can be described ’rigorously only by a symmetrical tensor of the second order Tik,
or better still by the corresponding mixed tensor-density T[k]i [; in]
harmony with this the potential of the gravitational field consists
of the components of a symmetrical tensor gik. Therefore, in
Einstein’s Theory we expect equation (10) to be replaced by a
system of equations of which the left side consists of differential
expressions of the second order in the gik’s, and the right side of
components of the energy-density; this system has to be invariant with respect to arbitrary transformations of the co-ordinates.
To find the law of gravitation we shall do best by taking up the
thread from Hamilton’s Principle formulated at the close of § 26.
The Action there consisted of three parts: the substance-action of
electricity, the field-action of electricity, and the substance-action
of mass or gravitation. In it there is lacking a fourth term, the
field-action of gravitation, which we have now to find. Before doing this, however, we shall calculate the change in the sum of the
first three terms already known, when we leave the potentials φi
of the electromagnetic field and the world-lines of the substanceelements unchanged but subject the gik’s, the potentials of the


-----

relativity.
This causes no change in the substance-action of electricity,
but the change in the integrands that occur in the field-action,
namely
1 [1]
2 **[S][ =]** 4 _[F][ik][F][ik]_

is
14 �√gδ(FikF ik) + (FikF ik)δ√g�.

The first summand in the curved bracket here = Frs δF _[rs]_ and
hence, since
_F_ _[rs]_ = g[ri]g[sk]Fik,

we immediately get the value

2[√]gFirFk[r] _[δg][ik][.]_

The second summand, by (58[′]) § 17,

= −Sgik δg[ik].

Thus, finally, we find the variation in the field-action to be

= � 1 � 1 (cf. (59), § 17)
2 **[S][ δg][ik][ dx][ =]** 2 **[S][ik][ δg][ik][ dx]**

if
**S[k]i** [=] [1]2 **[S][δ]i[k]** [=][ F][ir][F][kr] (11)

are the components of the energy-density of the electromagnetic
field.[∗] It suddenly becomes clear to us now (and only now that we

field) what is the origin of the complicated expressions (11) for
the energy-momentum density of the electromagnetic field.
We get a corresponding result for the substance-action of the
mass; for we have

_dxi dxk δgik_

_δ�gik dxi dxk =_ [1]2 = [1]2 _[ds u][i][u][k][ δg][ik][,]_

_ds_


and hence

�� �

Hence the total change in the Action so far known to us is, for
a variation of the metrical field,

� 1 (12)
2 **[T][ik][ δg][ik][ dx]**

in which T[k]i [denotes the tensor-density of the total energy.]
**The absent fourth term of the Action, namely, the**
**field-action of gravitation, must be an invariant integral,**
�
**G dx, of which the integrand G is composed of the poten-**

�ik�
tials gik and of the field-components of the gravitational
_r_

field, built up from the gik’s and their first derivatives. It would
seem to us that only under such circumstances do we obtain
differential equations of order not higher than the second for our
gravitational laws. If the total differential of this function is

in which the “Lagrange derivatives” [G][ik], which are symmetrical
in i and k, are to be calculated according to the formula

[G] = G[ik] _−_ _[∂][G][ik,r]_ _._

_∂xr_

The gravitational equations will then actually assume the form
which was predicted, namely

[G][k]i [=][ −][T]i[k][.] (15)

There is no longer any cause for surprise that it happens to be the
energy-momentum components that appear as co-efficients when
we vary the gik’s in the first three factors of the Action in accordance with (12). Unfortunately a scalar-density G, of the type we

�ik�
wish, does not exist at all; for we can make all the ’s vanish at
_r_

any given point by choosing the appropriate co-ordinate system.
Yet the scalar R, the curvature defined by Riemann, has made us
familiar with an invariant which involves the second derivatives of
the gik’s only linearly: it may even be shown that it is the only
invariant of this kind (vide Appendix II, in which the proof is
given). In consequence of this linearity we may use the invariant

partial integration. We then get

the form _[∂][w][i]_ : G here depends only on the gik’s and their first

since, according to the principle of partial integration,

Not **G dx itself is an invariant, but the variation δ** **G dx, and**

this is the essential feature of Hamilton’s Principle. We need not,

�
_therefore, have fears about introducing_ **G dx as the Action of**

_the gravitational field; and this hypothesis is found to be the only_
_possible one. We are thus led under compulsion, as it were, to_
the unique gravitational equations (15). It follows from them
that every kind of energy exerts a gravitational effect: this
is true not only of the energy concentrated in the electrons and
atoms, that is of matter in the restricted sense, but also of diffuse
field-energy (for the T[k]i [’s are the components of the total energy).]
Before we carry out the calculations that are necessary if we
wish to be able to write down the gravitational equations explicitly, we must first test whether we get analogous results in the

�
**case of Mie’s Theory. The Action,** **L dx, which occurs in it is**

an invariant not only for linear, but also for arbitrary transformations For L is composed algebraically (not as a result of tensor


-----

g p ), p _ik_
tensor of the second order (namely, of the electromagnetic field),
and of the components gik of the fundamental metrical tensor. We
set the total differential δL of this function equal to

12 **[T][ik][ δg][ik][ +][ δ][0][L][,]** in which δ0L = 2[1] **[H][ik][ δF][ik][ +][ s][i][ δφ][i]**

(T[ki] = T[ik], **H[ki]** = −H[ik]). (16)

We then call the tensor-density T[k]i [the energy or matter. By do-]
ing this, we affirm once again that the metrical field (with the
potentials gik) is related to matter (T[ik]) in the same way as the
electromagnetic field (with the potentials φi) is related to the electric current s[i]. We are now obliged to prove that the present explanation leads accurately to the expressions given in (64), § 26,
for energy and momentum. This will furnish the proof, which was
omitted above, of the symmetry of the energy-tensor. To do this
we cannot use the method of direct calculation as above in the
particular case of Maxwell’s Theory, but we must apply the following elegant considerations, the nucleus of which is to be found
in Lagrange, but which were discussed with due regard to formal
perfection by F. Klein (vide note 5).
We subject the world-continuum to an infinitesimal deformation, as a result of which in general the point (xi) becomes transformed into the point (¯xj)

_x¯i = xi + ϵ · ξ[i](x0, x1, x2, x3)_ (17)

(in which ϵ is the constant infinitesimal parameter, all of whose
higher powers are to be struck out). We imagine the phasequantities to follow the deformation so that at its conclusion the


-----

, q ( ), q

_φi(x) dxi = φ[¯]i(¯x) dx¯i_ (18)


hold; and in the same sense the symmetrical and skew-symmetrical
bilinear differential form with the co-efficients gik, Fik, respectively, remains unchanged. The changes _φ[¯]i(x) −_ _φi(x) which the_
quantities φi undergo at a fixed world-point (xi) as a result of
the deformation will be denoted by δφi; δgik and δFik have a
corresponding meaning.
If we replace the old quantities φi in the function L by the
¯
_φi arising from the deformation, we shall suppose the function_
**L¯ = L + δL to result; the δL in it is given by (16). Furthermore,**
let X be an arbitrary region of the world which, owing to the
deformation, becomes X. The deformation causes the Action
� �

**L dx to undergo a change δ[′]** **L dx which is equal to the**
X X

difference between the integral **L[¯] taken over X and the integral L**
taken over X. The invariance of the Action is expressed by the
equation

�
_δ[′]_ **L dx = 0.** (19)

X

We make a natural division of this difference into two parts:
(1) the difference between the integrals of **L[¯] and L over** X, (2) the
difference between the integral of L over X and X. Since X differs
from X only by an infinitesimal amount, we may set

for the first part. On page 165 we found the second part to be

the variations δφi, δgik, δFik. If we set _φ[¯]i(¯x) −_ _φi(x) = δ[′]φi for a_
moment, then, owing to (18), we get

_δ[′]φi · dxi + ϵφr dξ[r]_ = 0


and hence

Moreover, since

_δ[′]φi = −ϵ · φr_

_∂x[i]_ _[.]_


_δφi = δ[′]φi −_ �φ¯i(¯x) − _φ¯i(x)�_ = δ[′]φi − _ϵ ·_ _[∂φ]_ _ξ[r]_

we get, suppressing the self-evident factor ϵ,

_∂ξ[r]_
_−δφi = φr_ + _[∂φ][i]_ _ξ[r]._ (20)

_∂xi_ _∂xr_


In the same way, we get

And, on account of

_∂xk_ _∂xi_ _∂xk_ _∂xi_

If we remove the derivatives of ξ[i] by partial integration, and use
the abbreviation

It follows from this that, as we know, by choosing the ξ[i]’s appropriately, namely, so that they vanish outside a definite region,
which we here take to be X, we must have, at every point,

**ti = 0.** (23)

Accordingly, the first summand of (22) is also equal to zero. The
identity which comes about in this way is valid for arbitrary quantities ξ[i] and for any finite region of integration X. Hence, since the
integral of a continuous function taken over any and every region
can vanish only if the function itself = 0, we must have

_∂(∂xVi[k]k[ξ][i][)]_ = Vi[k] _∂x∂ξk[i]_ + _[∂]∂x[V]ki[k]_ _ξ[i]_ = 0.

These considerations simultaneously give us the theorems of
conservation of energy and of momentum, which we found by calculation in § 26; they are contained in equations (23). The change
in the Action of the whole world for an infinitesimal deformation
which vanishes outside a finite region of the world is found to be

� _δL dx =_ � 12 **[T][ik][ δg][ik][ dx][ +]** � _δ0L dx = 0._ (24)

In consequence of the equations (21) and of Hamilton’s Princi**ple, namely**

which is here valid, the second part (in Maxwell’s equations) disappears. But the first part, as we have already calculated, is

The Hamiltonian Principle which has been supplemented by

and in which the electromagnetic and the gravitational condition
(phase) of the field may be subjected independently of one another
to virtual infinitesimal variations gives rise to the gravitational
equations (15) in addition to the electromagnetic laws. If we apply
the process above, which ended in (26), to G instead of to L—
here, too, we have, for the variation δ caused by a deformation of
the world-continuum which vanishes outside a finite region, that

The fact that G contains the derivatives of the gik’s as well as
the gik’s themselves is of no account. Accordingly, the mechanical

The wonderful relationships, which here reveal themselves,
may be formulated in the following way independently of the question whether Mie’s theory of electrodynamics is valid or not. The

phase-quantities φ (these were our φi’s above). Besides these, we
have also to take account of the metrical field in which the system is embedded and which is characterised by its potentials gik.

tem is expressed by an invariant integral **L dx; in it, the scalar-**

density L is a function of the φ’s and of their derivatives of the
first and if need be, of the second order, and also a function of
the gik’s, but the latter quantities alone and not their derivatives
occur in L. We form the total differential of the function L by
writing down explicitly only that part which contains the differentials δgik, namely,

_δL =_ [1]

2 **[T][ik][δg][ik][ +][ δ][0][L][.]**

**T[k]i** [is then the tensor-density of the][ energy][ (identical with][ mat-]
**ter) associated with the physical state or phase of the system. The**
determination of its components is thus reduced once and for all to
a determination of Hamilton’s Function L. The general theory of
_relativity alone, which allows the process of variation to be applied_
_to the metrical structure of the world, leads to a true definition_
_of energy. The phase-laws emerge from the “partial” principle of_
action in which only the phase-quantities φ are to be subjected to
variation; just as many equations arise from it as there are quantities φ. The additional ten gravitational equations (15) for the ten
potentials gik result if we enlarge the partial principle of action to
the total one (27), in which the gik’s are also to be subjected to
variation. The mechanical equations (26) are a consequence of
the phase laws as well as of the gravitational laws; they may in

tions. The general solution must, in fact, contain four arbitrary
functions, since the equations, in virtue of their invariant character, leave the co-ordinate system of the xi’s indeterminate; hence,
arbitrary continuous transformations of these co-ordinates derived
from one solution of the equations always give rise to new solutions in their turn. (These solutions, however, represent the same
objective course of the world.) The old subdivision into geometry,
mechanics, and physics must be replaced in Einstein’s Theory by
the separation into physical phases and metrical or gravitational
fields.
For the sake of completeness we shall once again revert to the
Hamiltonian Principle used in the theory of Lorentz and Maxwell.
Variation applied to the φi’s gives the electromagnetic laws, but
applied to the gik’s the gravitational laws. Since the Action is an
invariant, the infinitesimal change which an infinitesimal deformation of the world-continuum calls up in it = 0; this deformation is
to affect the electromagnetic and the gravitational field as well as
the world-lines of the substance-elements. This change consists of
three summands, namely, of the changes which are caused in turn
by the variation of the electromagnetic field, of the gravitational
field, and of the substance-paths. The first two parts are zero as
a consequence of the electromagnetic and the gravitational laws;
hence the third part also vanishes and we see that the mechanical
equations are a result of the two groups of laws mentioned just
above. Recapitulating our former calculations we may derive this
result by taking the following steps. From the gravitational laws
there follow (26), i.e.

_∂xi_

As a result of Maxwell’s equations the right-hand member of (28)

= pi = −Fiks[k] (s[i] = ρu[i]).

If we then multiply (28) by u[i] and sum up with respect to i, we get
_M = 0; in this way we have arrived at the equation of continuity_
for matter and also at the mechanical equations in their usual
form.
After having gained a full survey of how the gravitational laws
of Einstein are to be arranged into the scheme of the remaining
physical laws, we are still faced with the task of working out the
explicit expression for the [G][k]i [’s (][vide][ note 6][). The virtual change]

or, for any arbitrary co-ordinate system,

The divergence disappears in the integration and hence, since
by definition we are to have

_δ_ _R[√]g dx =_ [G][ik] _δgik dx = −_ [G]ik δg[ik] _dx_

and since the Rik’s are symmetrical in Riemann’s space, we get

still appear doubtful now at the outset whether κ is positive or
negative, and whether the right-hand side of equation (29) should
not be of opposite sign. We shall find, however, in the next paragraph that, in virtue of the fact that masses attract one another
and do not repel, κ is actually positive.
It is of mathematical importance to notice that the exact
**gravitational laws are not linear; although they are linear in**

�ik�
the derivatives of the field-components, they are not linear
_r_

in the field-components themselves. If we contract equations (29),
that is, set k = i, and sum with respect to i, we get −R = T = T[i]i[;]
hence, in place of (29) we may also write

**R[k]i** [=][ T]i[k] _[−]_ [1]2 _[δ]i[k][T][.]_ (30)


In the first paper in which Einstein set up the gravitational
equations without following on from Hamilton’s Principle, the
term − [1]2 _[δ]i[k][T][ was missing on the right-hand side; he recognised]_

only later that it is required as a result of the energy-momentumtheorem (vide note 7). The whole series of relations here described
and which is subject to Hamilton’s Principle, has become manifest
in further works by H. A. Lorentz, Hilbert, Einstein, Klein, and
the author (vide note 8).

grounds, and above all, whether the motions of the planets can
be explained just as well (or better) by it as by Newton’s law of
attraction. §§ 29–32 treat of the solution of the gravitational equations. The discussion of the general theory will not be resumed
till § 33.

**§ 29. The Stationary Gravitational Field—Comparison**
**with Experiment**

To establish the relationship of Einstein’s laws with the results
of observations of the planetary system, we shall first specialise
them for the case of a stationary gravitational field (vide note 9).
The latter is characterised by the circumstance that, if we use
appropriate co-ordinates, the world resolves into space and time,
so that for the metrical form


_ds[2]_ = f [2] _dt[2]_ _−_ _dσ[2],_ _dσ[2]_ =


3
�

_γik dxi dxk,_
_i,k=1_


we get

_g00 = f_ [2]; _g0i = gi0 = 0;_ _gik = −γik_ (i, k = 1, 2, 3),

and also that the co-efficients f and γ[ik] occurring in it depend
only on the space-co-ordinates x1, x2, x3, and not on the time
_t = x0. dσ[2]_ is a positive definite quadratic differential form which
determines the metrical nature of the space having co-ordinates
_x1, x2, x3; f is obviously the velocity of light. The measure t of_
time is fully determined (when the unit of time has been chosen)


-----

y p p, p
ordinates x1, x2, x3 are fixed only to the extent of an arbitrary continuous transformation of these co-ordinates among themselves.
In the statical case, therefore, the metrics of the world gives, besides the measure-determination of the space, also a scalar field f
in space.
If we denote the Christoffel 3-indices symbol, relating to the
ternary form dσ[2], by an appended ∗, and if the index letters i, k, l
assume only the values 1, 2, 3 in turn, then it easily follows from
definition that

In the above, fi = _[∂f]_ are co-variant components of the three

For statical matter which is non-coherent (i.e. of which the parts
do not act on one another by means of stresses), T[0]0 [=][ µ][ is the only]
component of the energy-density tensor that is not zero; hence
**T = µ.** Matter at rest produces a statical gravitational field.
Among the gravitational equations (30) the only one that is of
interest to us is the �0�th: it gives us
0

∆f = [1] (32)

2 _[µ]_

or, if we insert the constant factor of proportionality 8πκ, we get

∆f = 4πκµ. (32[′])

If we assume that, for an appropriate choice of the space-coordinates x1, x2, x3, ds[2] differs only by an infinitesimal amount
from
_c[2]_ _dt[2]_ _−_ (dx[2]1 [+][ dx]2[2] [+][ dx]3[2][)] (33)

—the masses producing the gravitational field must be infinitely
small if this is to be true—we get, by setting

∆Φ = _[∂][2][Φ]_ + _[∂][2][Φ]_ + _[∂][2][Φ]_ = 4πκcµ, (10)

and µ is c-times the mass-density in the ordinary units. We find
that actually, according to all our geometric observations, this
assumption is very approximately true for the planetary system.
Since the masses of the planets are very small compared with
the mass of the sun which produces the field and is to be considered at rest, we may treat the former as “test-bodies” that are
embedded in the gravitational field of the sun. The motion of
each of them is then given by a geodetic world-line in this statical
gravitational field, if we neglect the disturbances due to the influence of the planets on one another. The motion thus satisfies the

that is, the planet of mass m moves according to the laws of classical mechanics, if we assume that a force with the potential mΦ
acts in it. In this way we have linked up the theory with
**that of Newton: Φ is the Newtonian potential that satisfies Pois-**
son’s equation (10), and k = c[2]κ is the gravitational constant of
Newton. From the well-known numerical value of the Newtonian
constant k, we get for 8πκ the numerical value

8πκ = [8][π][k]

_c[2][ = 1][.][87][ ·][ 10][−][27][cm][ ·][ gr][−][1][.]_

The deviation of the metrical groundform from that of Euclid (33)
is thus considerable enough to make the geodetic world-lines differ
from rectilinear uniform motion by the amount actually shown
by planetary motion although the geometry which is valid in

concerned. (The sum of the angles in a geodetic triangle of these
dimensions differs very very slightly from 180[◦].) The chief cause
of this is that the radius of the earth’s orbit amounts to about
eight light-minutes whereas the time of revolution of the world in
its orbit is a whole year!
We shall pursue the exact theory of the motion of a point-mass
and of light-rays in a statical gravitational field a little further
(vide note 10). According to § 17 the geodetic world-lines may be
characterised by the two principles of variation

_δ_ � �Q ds = 0 or _δ_ � _Q ds = 0,_ in which Q = gik _dxi_ _dxk_

_ds_ _ds [.][ (35)]_


The second of these takes for granted that the parameter s has
been chosen suitably. The second alone is of account for the “nulllines” which satisfy the condition Q = 0 and depict the progress
of a light-signal. The variation must be performed in such a way
that the ends of the piece of world-line under consideration remain
unchanged. If we subject only x0 = t to variation, we get in the
statical case


_δ_ � _Q ds =_ �2f [2] _[dx][0]_

_ds [δx][0]_

Thus we find that

_δx0 ds._ (36)


_f_ [2][ dx][0] holds.

_ds_ [=][ const.]

If, for the present, we keep our attention fixed on the case of the
light ray we can by choosing the unit of measure of the parame


-----

p y ),
which occurs on the right equal to unity. If we now carry out the
variation more generally by varying the spatial path of the ray
whilst keeping the ends fixed but dropping the subsidiary condition imposed by time, namely, that δx0 = 0 for the ends, then, as
is evident from (36), the principle becomes

� �
_δ_ _Q ds = 2[δt] = 2δ_ _dt._

If the path after variation is, in particular, traversed with the
velocity of light just as the original path, then for the varied worldline, too, we have

_Q = 0,_ _dσ = f dt,_

and we get

� � _dσ_
_δ_ _dt = δ_ (37)

_f_ [= 0][.]

This equation fixes only the spatial position of the light-ray; it is
nothing other than Fermat’s principle of the shortest path.
In the last formulation time has been eliminated entirely; it is
valid for any arbitrary portion of the path of the light-ray if the
latter alters its position by an infinitely small amount, its ends
being kept fixed.
If, for a statical field of gravitation, we use any space-coordinates x1, x2, x3, we may construct a graphical representation
of a Euclidean space by representing the point whose co-ordinates
are x1, x2, x3 by means of a point whose Cartesian co-ordinates are
_x1 x2 x3 If we mark the position of two stars S1 S2 which are at_

g pp
equal to the angle between the straight lines BS1, BS2 connecting the stars with the observer; we must connect B with S1, S2
by means of the curved lines of shortest path resulting from (37)
and then, by means of an auxiliary construction, transform the
angle which these two lines make with one another at B from Euclidean measure to that of Riemann determined by the metrical
groundform dσ[2] (cf. formula (15), § 11). The angles which have
been calculated in this way are those which determine the actually
observed position of the stars to one another, and which are read
off on the divided circle of the observing instrument. Whereas
_B, S1, S2 retain their positions in space, this angle S1BS2 may_
change, if great masses happen to get into proximity of the path of
the rays. It is in this sense that we may talk of light-rays being
**curved as a result of the gravitational field. But the rays are**
not, as we assumed in § 12 to get at general results, geodetic lines
in space with the metrical groundform dσ[2]; they do not make the

� � _dσ_
integral _dσ but_ _f_ [assume a limiting value. The bending of]

light-rays occur, in particular, in the gravitational field of the sun.
If for our graphical representation we use co-ordinates x1, x2, x3,
for which the Euclidean formula dσ[2] = dx[2]1 [+][dx][2]2 [+][dx][2]3 [holds at in-]
finity, then numerical calculation for the case of a light-ray passing
by close to the sun shows that it must be diverted from its path to
the extent of 1.74 seconds (vide § 31). This entails a displacement
of the positions of the stars in the apparent immediate neighbourhood of the sun, which should certainly be measurable. These
positions of the stars can be observed, of course, only during a
total eclipse of the sun. The stars which come into consideration

sufficiently far removed to avoid being masked by the brilliance of
the corona. The most favourable day for such an observation is
the 29th May, and it was a piece of great good fortune that a total
eclipse of the sun occurred on the 29th May, 1919. Two English
expeditions were dispatched to the zone in which the total eclipse
was observable, one to Sobral in North Brazil, the other to the Island of Principe in the Gulf of Guinea, for the express purpose of
ascertaining the presence or absence of the Einstein displacement.
The effect was found to be present to the amount predicted; the
final results of the measurements were 1.98[′′] _± 0.12[′′]_ for Sobral,
1.61[′′] _± 0.30[′′]_ for Principe (vide note 11).
Another optical effect which should present itself, according
to Einstein’s theory of gravitation, in the statical field and which,
under favourable conditions, may just be observable, arises from
the relationship
_ds = f dt_

holding between the cosmic time dt and the proper-time ds at a
fixed point in space. If two sodium atoms at rest are objectively
fully alike, then the events that give rise to the light-waves of
the D-line in each must have the same frequency, as measured in
**proper-time. Hence, if f has the values f1, f2, respectively at**
the points at which the atoms are situated, then between f1, f2
and the frequencies ν1, ν2 in cosmic time, there will exist the
relationship
_ν1_
= _[ν][2]_ _._
_f1_ _f2_

But the light-waves emitted by an atom will have, of course, the
f d i **i** ti t ll i t i


-----

(,, q
tion in which time is represented by the factor e[iνt], ν being an
arbitrary constant frequency). Consequently, if we compare the
sodium D-line produced in a spectroscope by the light sent from a
star of great mass with the same line sent by an earth-source into
the same spectroscope, there should be a slight displacement of
the former line towards the red as compared with the latter, since
_f has a slightly smaller value in the neighbourhood of great masses_
than at a great distance from them. The ratio in which the frequency is reduced, has according to our approximate formula (34)
the value 1− _[κm][0]_ at the distance r from a mass m0. At the surface

_r_
of the sun this amounts to a displacement of .008 Angströms for
a line in the blue corresponding to the wave-length 4000 Å. This
effect lies just within the limits of observability. Superimposed on
this, there are the disturbances due to the Doppler effect, the uncertainty of the means used for comparison on the earth, certain
irregular fluctuations in the sun’s lines the causes of which have
been explained only partly, and finally, the mutual disturbances
of the densely packed lines of the sun owing to the overlapping of
their intensities (which, under certain circumstances, causes two
lines to merge into one with a single maximum of intensity). If all
these factors are taken into consideration, the observations that
have so far been made, seem to confirm the displacement towards
the red to the amount stated (vide note 12). This question cannot,
however, yet be considered as having been definitely answered.
A third possibility of controlling the theory by means of experiment is this. According to Einstein, Newton’s theory of the
planets is only a first approximation. The question suggests itlf h th th di b t Ei t i ’ Th d th

disposal. It is clear that the chances for this are most favourable
for the planet Mercury which is nearest the sun. In actual fact,
after Einstein had carried the approximation a step further, and
after Schwarzschild (vide note 13) had determined accurately the
radially symmetrical field of gravitation produced by a mass at
rest and also the path of a point-mass of infinitesimal mass, both
found that the elliptical orbit of Mercury should undergo
**a slow rotation in the same direction as the orbit is tra-**
**versed (over and above the disturbances produced by the remain-**
ing planets), amounting to 43[′′] **per century. Since the time of**
Leverrier an effect of this magnitude has been known among the
secular disturbances of Mercury’s perihelion, which could not be
accounted for by the usual causes of disturbance. Manifold hypotheses have been proposed to remove this discrepancy between
theory and observation (vide note 14). We shall revert to the
rigorous solution given by Schwarzschild in § 31.
Thus we see that, however great is the revolution produced in
our ideas of space and time by Einstein’s theory of gravitation,
the actual deviations from the old theory are exceedingly small in
our field of observation. Those which are measurable have been
confirmed up to now. The chief support of the theory is to be
found less in that lent by observation hitherto than in its inherent
logical consistency, in which it far transcends that of classical mechanics, and also in the fact that it solves the perplexing problem
of gravitation and of the relativity of motion at one stroke in a
manner highly satisfying to our reason.
Using the same method as for the light-ray, we may set up for
the motion of a point-mass in a statical gravitational field a “min

**§ 30. Gravitational Waves**

By assuming that the generating energy-field T[k]i [is infinitely]
weak, Einstein has succeeded in integrating the gravitational equations generally (vide note 15). The gik’s will, under these circum0
stances, if the co-ordinates are suitably chosen, differ from the _gik’s_
by only infinitesimal amounts γik. We then regard the world as
“Euclidean,” having the metrical groundform

0
_gik dxi dxk_ (41)

and the γik’s as the components of a symmetrical tensor-field of
the second order in this world. The operations that are to be performed in the sequel will always be based on the metrical groundform (41). For the present we are again dealing with the special theory of relativity. We shall consider the co-ordinate system
0
which is chosen to be a “normal” one, so that _gik = 0 for i ̸= k_
and
0 0 0
_g00 = 1,_ _g11 =_ _g22 =_ _g33 = −1._

_x0 is the time, x1, x2, x3 are Cartesian space-co-ordinates; the_
velocity of light is taken equal to unity.
We introduce the quantities

_∂ψi[k]_ = 0. (42)

For, if this is not so initially, we may, by an infinitesimal change,
alter the co-ordinate system so that (42) holds. The transformation formulæ that lead to a new co-ordinate system ¯x, namely,

_x¯i = xi + ξ(x0, x1, x2, x3)_

contain the unknown functions ξ[i], which are of the same order of
infinitesimals as the γ’s. We get new co-efficients ¯gik for which,
according to earlier formulæ, we must have

_∂ξ[r]_ _∂ξ[r]_
_gik(x) −_ _g¯ik(x) = gir_ + gkr + _[∂g][ik]_ _ξ[r]_

so that, here, we have

and we finally get

that such an invariant normalisation is possible.

Accordingly, every change in the distribution of matter produces a
_gravitational effect which is propagated in space with the velocity of_
_light. Oscillating masses produce gravitational waves. Nowhere in_
the Nature accessible to us do mass-oscillations of sufficient power
occur to allow the resulting gravitational waves to be observed.
Equations (43) correspond fully to the electromagnetic equations

**Plane gravitational waves may exist: they are propagated**
in space free from matter: we get them by making the same supposition as in optics, i.e. by setting

The a[k]i [’s and the][ α][i][’s are constants; the latter satisfy the condition]
_αiα[i]_ = 0. Moreover, α0 = ν is the frequency of the vibration and
_α1x1 + α2x2 + α3x3 = const. are the planes of constant phase._
The differential equations ∇ψi[k] [= 0][ are satisfied identically. The]
secondary conditions (42) require that

_a[k]i_ _[α][k]_ [= 0][.] (44)

If the x1-axis is the direction of propagation of the wave, we have

_α2 = α3 = 0,_ _−α1 = α0 = ν,_

and equations (44) state that

since the a’s with the index 0 are determined from these by (45);
the space part, however, is subject to no limitation. In its turn it

H. Thirring has made two interesting applications of integration based on the method of approximation used here for the
gravitational equations (vide note 16). With its help he has investigated the influence of the rotation of a large, heavy, hollow
sphere on the motion of point-masses situated near the centre of
the sphere. He discovered, as was to be expected, a force effect
of the same kind as centrifugal force. In addition to this a second
force appears which seeks to drag the body into the equatorial
plane according to the same law as that according to which centrifugal force seeks to drive it away from the axis. Secondly (in
conjunction with J. Lense), he has studied the influence of the
rotation of a central body on its planets or moons respectively

Now that we have considered in §§ 29, 30 the approximate
integration of the gravitational equations that occur if only linear
terms are taken into account, we shall next endeavour to arrive
at rigorous solutions: our attention will, however, be confined to
statical gravitation.

**§ 31. Rigorous Solution of the Problem of One Body[∗]**

For a statical gravitational field we have

_ds[2]_ = f [2] _dx[2]0_ _[−]_ _[dσ][2]_

in which dσ[2] is a definitely positive quadratic form in the threespace variables x1, x2, x3; the velocity of light f is likewise dependent only on these. The field is radially symmetrical if,
for a proper choice of the space-co-ordinates, f and dσ[2] are invariant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations of these
co-ordinates. If this is to be the case, f must be a function of the
distance
�
_r =_ _x[2]1_ [+][ x]2[2] [+][ x]3[2][,]

from the centre, but dσ[2] must have the form

_λ(dx[2]1_ [+][ dx]2[2] [+][ dx]3[2][) +][ l][(][x][1] _[dx][1]_ [+][ x][2] _[dx][2]_ [+][ x][3] _[dx][3][)][2]_ (46)

in which λ and l are likewise functions of r alone. Without disturbing this normal form we may subject the space-co-ordinates
to a further transformation which consists in replacing x1, x2, x3

y 1[,] 2[,] 3[,] p p y g y
function of the distance r. By choosing λ appropriately we may
clearly succeed in getting λ = 1; let us suppose this to have been
done. Then, using the notation of § 29, we have

_γik = −gik = δi[k]_ [+][ l][ ·][ x][i][x][k] (i, k = 1, 2, 3).

We shall next define this radially symmetrical field so that it
satisfies the homogeneous gravitational equations which hold
wherever there is no matter, that is, wherever the energydensity T[k]i [vanishes.] These equations are all included in the
principle of variation

**The gravitational field, which we are seeking, is that which is**

If we wish to take the world-integral G over a fixed interval with
respect to the time x0, and over a shell enclosed by two spherical
surfaces with respect to space, then, since the element of integration is
_dx = dx0 · dΩ_ _· r[2]_ _dr_ (dΩ= solid angle),

the equation of variation that is to be solved is

By varying w, we get

∆[′] = 0, ∆= const.

and hence, if we choose the unit of time suitably

∆= hf = 1.

Partial integration gives

_w∆[′]_ _dr = [w, ∆] −_ ∆w[′] _dr._

Hence, if we vary ∆, we arrive at

_w[′]_ = 0, _w = const. = 2m._

Finally, from the definition of w and ∆= 1, we get

_f_ [2] = 1 − [2][m] _h[2]_ = [1]

_r_ [,] _f_ [2]

This completes the solution of the problem. The unit of time has
been chosen so that the velocity of light at infinity = 1. For distances r, which are great compared with m, the Newtonian value
of the potential holds in the sense that the quantity m0, introduced by the equation m = κm0 occurs as the field-producing
**mass in it; we call m the gravitational radius of the matter**

�
_m0 =_ _µ dx1 dx2 dx3._

Since f [2] cannot become negative, it is clear from this that, if we
use the co-ordinates here introduced for the region of space devoid
of matter, r must be > 2m. Further light is shed on this by the
special case of a sphere of liquid which is to be discussed in § 32,
and for which the gravitational field inside the mass, too, will be
determined. We may apply the solution found to the gravitational
field of the sum external to itself if we neglect the effect due to the
planets and the distant stars. The gravitational radius is about
1.47 kilometres for the sun’s mass, and only 5 millimetres for the
earth.
The motion of a planet (supposed infinitesimal in comparison
with the sun’s mass) is represented by a geodetic world-line. Of

This theorem differs from the similar one derived in Newton’s

cosmic time, but according to the proper-time s of the planet. On
account of the Law of Areas the motion takes place in a plane that
we may choose as our co-ordinate plane x3 = 0. If we introduce

Einstein (vide note 19).

_The geometry which holds on this plane is therefore the same as_

(vide note 20).
A charged sphere, besides calling up a radially symmetrical
gravitational field, calls up a similar electrostatic field. Since both
fields influence one another mutually, they may be determined
only conjointly and simultaneously (vide note 21). If we use the
ordinary units of the c.g.s. system (and not those of Heaviside
which dispose of the factor 4π in another way and which we have
generally used in the foregoing) for electricity as well as for the
other quantities, then in the region devoid of masses and charges
the integral becomes

The notation is the same as above, Φ denoting the electrostatic
potential. The square of the numerical value of the field is used as
a basis for the function of Action of the electric field, in accordance
with the classical theory. Variation of w gives, just as in the case
of no charges,
∆[′] = 0, ∆= const. = c.

But variation of Φ leads to

For the electrostatic potential we therefore get the same formula

as r increases. √We call m = κm0 the gravitational radius of the

_c [e][0][ =][ e][ the gravitational radius of the charge][ e][0][.]_
Our formula leads to a view of the structure of the elec

**p** ;
this has been found to be necessary, if one is to avoid coming to
the conclusion that the electrostatic field it produces has infinite
total energy, and hence an infinitely great inertial mass. If the
inertial mass of the electron is derived from its field-energy alone,
then its radius is of the order of magnitude

_a =_ _e[2]0_
_m0c[2]_ _[.]_

But in our formula a finite mass m0 (producing the gravitational
field) occurs quite independently of the smallness of the value of r
for which the formula is regarded as valid; how are these results to
be reconciled? According to Faraday’s view the charge enclosed
by a surface Ω is nothing more than the flux of the electrical
field through Ω. Analogously to this it will be found in the next
paragraph that the true meaning of the conception of mass, both
as field-producing mass and as inertial or gravitational mass, is
expressed by a field-flux. If we are to regard the statical solution
here given as valid for all space, the flux of the electrical field
through any sphere is 4πe0 at the centre. On the other hand the
mass which is enclosed by a sphere of radius r, assumes the value

_m0 −_ [1]2 _ce[2][2]0r_

which is dependent on the value of r. The mass is consequently
distributed continuously. The density of mass coincides, of course,
with the density of energy. The “initial level” at the centre, from
which the mass is to be calculated, is not equal to 0 but to −∞.
Therefore the mass m of the electron cannot be determined from

encloses the mass zero. Contrary to Mie’s view matter now appears as a real singularity of the field. In the general theory
of relativity, however, space is no longer assumed to be Euclidean,
and hence we are not compelled to ascribe to it the relationships
of Euclidean space. It is quite possible that it has other limits
besides infinity, and, in particular, that its relationships are like
those of a Euclidean space which contains punctures (cf. § 34). We
may, therefore, claim for the ideas here developed—according to
which there is no connection between the total mass of the electron and the potential of the field it produces, and in which there
is no longer a meaning in talking of a cohesive pressure holding
the electron together—equal rights as for those of Mie. An unsatisfactory feature of the present theory is that the field is to be
entirely free of charge, whereas the mass (= energy) is to permeate
the whole of the field with a density that diminishes continuously.
It is to be noted that a : e = e : m or, that e = _[√]am. In_
the case of the electron the quotient _[e]_

pulsion which two electrons (separated by a great distance) exert
upon one another is 10[40] times as great as that which they exert
in virtue of gravitation. The circumstance that in an electron an
integral number of this kind occurs which is of an order of magnitude varying greatly from unity makes the thesis contained in
Mie’s Theory, namely, that all pure figures determined from the
measures of the electron must be derivable as mathematical constants from the exact physical laws, rather doubtful: on the other
hand, we regard with equal scepticism the belief that the struc

The gravitational field that is present in the interior of mas**sive bodies is, according to Einstein’s Theory, determined only**
when the dynamical constitution of the bodies are fully known;
since the mechanical conditions are included in the gravitational
equations, the conditions of equilibrium are given for the statical
case. The simplest conditions that offer themselves for consideration are given when we deal with bodies that are composed of
a homogeneous incompressible fluid. The energy-tensor of a
fluid on which no volume forces are acting is given according to
§ 25, by
_Tik = µ[∗]u[i]uk −_ _pgik_
in which the ui’s are co-variant components of the world-direction
of the matter, the scalar p denotes the pressure, and µ[∗] is determined from the constant density µ0 by means of the equation
_µ[∗]_ = µ0 + p. We introduce the quantities

_µ[∗]ui = vi_

as independent variables, and set

equations.
In the statical case, v1 = v2 = v3 = 0, and all quantities are
independent of the time. We set v0 = v and apply the symbol of
variation δ just as in § 28 to denote a change that is produced by an

**T[ik]** _δgik dx = 0,_

and from the equation

for ds[2], involving the three unknown functions λ, l, f, as at the

which is derived by varying λ. A full substitute for it is clearly
given by the equation that asserts the invariance of the Action
during an infinitesimal spatial displacement in radial directions,
that is, the theorem of momentum : v = const. The problem of

gravitational radius m of the sphere of fluid

_m =_ _[µ][0]6[r]0[3]_ _[.]_

The inequality, which holds between r0 and µ0, shows that the
radius r0 must be greater than 2m. Hence, if we start from infinity,
then, before we get to the singular sphere r = 2m mentioned
above, we reach the fluid, within which other laws hold. If we
now adopt the gramme as our unit, we must replace µ0 by 8πκµ0,
whereas m = κm0, if m0 denotes the gravitating mass. We then

These results for a sphere of fluid were first obtained by
Schwarzschild (vide note 22). After the most important cases of
radially symmetrical statical gravitational fields had been solved,
the author succeeded in solving the more general problem of
the cylindrically symmetrical statical field (vide note 23).
We shall here just mention briefly the simplest results of this
investigation. Let us consider first uncharged masses and a
gravitational field in space free from matter. It then follows from
the gravitational equations, if certain space-co-ordinates r, θ, z
(so-called canonical cylindrical co-ordinates) are used, that


_ds[2]_ = f [2] _dt[2]_ _−_ _dσ[2],_ _dσ[2]_ = h(dr[2] + dz[2]) + _[r][2][ dθ][2]_ _._

_f_ [2]

_θ is an angle whose modulus is 2π; that is, corresponding to_
values of θ that differ by integral multiples of 2π there is only one
point. On the axis of rotation r = 0. Also, h and f are functions
of r and z. We shall plot real space in terms of a Euclidean
space, in which r, θ, z are cylindrical co-ordinates. The canonical
co-ordinate system is uniquely defined except for a displacement
in the direction of the axis of rotation z[′] = z + const. When
_h = f = 1, dσ[2]_ is identical with the metrical groundform of the
Euclidean picture-space (used for the plotting). The gravitational
problem may be solved just as easily on this theory as on that
of Newton, if the distribution of the matter is known in terms
of canonical co-ordinates. For if we transfer these masses into
our picture space that is if we make the mass contained in


-----

Newtonian potential of this mass-distribution in the Euclidean
picture-space, the simple formula

_f = e[ψ/c][2]_ (54)

holds. The second still unknown function h may also be determined by the solution of an ordinary Poisson equation (referring
to the meridian plane θ = 0). In the case of charged bodies,
too, the canonical co-ordinate system exists. If we assume that
the masses are negligible in comparison with the charges, that is,
that for an arbitrary portion of space the gravitational radius of
the electric charges contained in it is much greater than the gravitational radius of the masses contained in it, and if φ denotes
the electrostatic potential (calculated according to the classical
theory) of the transposed charges in the canonical picture-space,
then f and the electrostatic potential Φ in real space are given by
the formulæ

It is not quite easy to subordinate the radially symmetrical case
to this more general theory: it becomes necessary to carry out a
rather complicated transformation of the space-co-ordinates, into
which we shall not enter here.
Just as the laws of Mie’s electrodynamics are non-linear, so
also Einstein’s laws of gravitation. This non-linearity is not
perceptible in those measurements that are accessible to direct
observation because in them the non linear terms are quite neg

by the interplay of forces in the visible world. Only, perhaps, for
the unusual occurrences within the atom, of which we have as
yet no clear picture, does this non-linearity come into consideration. Non-linear differential equations involve, in comparison with
linear equations, particularly as regards singularities, extremely
intricate, unexpected, and, at the present, quite uncontrollable
conditions. The suggestion immediately arises that these two circumstances, the remarkable behaviour of non-linear differential
equations and the peculiarities of intra-atomic occurrences, are to
be related to one another. Equations (54) and (54[′]) offer a beautiful and simple example of how the principle of superposition
becomes modified in the strict theory of gravitation: the fieldpotentials f and Φ depend in the one case on the exponential
function of the quantity ψ, and in the other on a trigonometrical function of the quantity φ, these quantities being those which
satisfy the principle of superposition. At the same time, however,
these equations demonstrate clearly that the non-linearity of the
gravitational equations will be of no assistance whatever for explaining the occurrences within the atom or the constitution of the
electron. For the differences between φ and Φ become appreciable

spatial infinity, to

the expression which is a characteristic of the special theory of
relativity.
A further series of elegant investigations into problems of statical gravitation have been initiated by Levi-Civita (vide note 24).
The Italian mathematicians have studied, besides the statical case,
also the “stationary” one, which is characterised by the circumstance that all the gik’s are independent of the time-co-ordinate x0,
whereas the “lateral” co-efficients g01, g02, g03 need not vanish (vide
note 25): an example of this is given by the field that surrounds
a body which is in stationary rotation.

**§ 33. Gravitational Energy. The Theorems of**
**Conservation**

An isolated system sweeps out in the course of its history
a “world-canal”; we assume that outside this canal the streamdensity s[i] vanishes (if not entirely, at least to such a degree that
the following argument retains its validity). It follows from the
equation of continuity
_∂s[i]_

= 0 (55)
_∂xi_

that the flux of the vector-density s[i] has the same value e through
every three dimensional “plane” across the canal To fix the sign


-----

p **g** y
If the co-ordinate system fulfils the conditions that every “plane”
_x0 = const. intersects the canal in a finite region and that these_
planes, arranged according to increasing values of x0, follow one
another in the order, past → future, then we may calculate e by
means of the equation

�
**s[0]** _dx1 dx2 dx3 = e_

in which the integration is taken over any arbitrary plane of the
family x0 = const. This integral e = e(x0) is accordingly independent of the “time” x0, as is readily seen, too, from (55) if we
integrate it with respect to the “space-co-ordinates” x1, x2, x3.
What has been stated above is valid in virtue of the equation
of continuity alone; the idea of substance and the convention to
which it leads in Lorentz’s Theory, namely, s[i] = ρu[i] do not come
into question in this case.
Does a similar theorem of conservation hold true for en**ergy and momentum? This can certainly not be decided from**
the equation (26) of § 28, since the latter contains the additional
term which is a characteristic of the theory of gravitation. It is
**possible, however, to write this addition term, too, in the form**
of a divergence. We choose a definite co-ordinate system and
subject the world-continuum to an infinitesimal deformation in
the true sense, that is, we choose constants for the deformation
components ξ[i] in § 28. Then, of course, for any finite region X

If we introduce the quantities

Since this holds for any arbitrary region X, the integrand must be
equal to zero. In it the ξ[i]’s denote arbitrary constant numbers;
hence we get four identities:

and, accordingly, the mechanical equations (26) become

_∂U[k]i_ = 0, where U[k]i [=][ T]i[k] [+][ t]i[k][.] (56)
_∂xk_

It is thus shown that if we regard the t[k]i [’s, which are dependent]
only on the potentials and the field-components of gravitation, as
the components of the energy-density of the gravitational
**field, we get pure divergence equations for all energy associated**
with “physical state or phase” and “gravitation” (vide note 26).
And yet, physically, it seems devoid of sense to introduce
the t[k]i [’s as energy-components of the gravitational field, for these]
quantities neither form a tensor nor are they symmetrical.
In actual fact, if we choose an appropriate co-ordinate system, we
may make all the t[k]i [’s at one point vanish; it is only necessary to]
choose a geodetic co-ordinate system. And, on the other hand, if
we use a curvilinear co-ordinate system in a “Euclidean” world totally devoid of gravitation, we get t[k]i [’s that are all different from]
zero, although the existence of gravitational energy in this case
can hardly come into question. Hence, although the differential
relations (56) have no real physical meaning, we can derive from
them, by integrating over an isolated system, an invariant
theorem of conservation (vide note 27).
During motion an isolated system with its accompanying gravitational field sweeps out a canal in the “world”. Beyond the canal,

then use co-ordinates x0 (= t), x1, x2, x3, such that the metrical
groundform assumes constant co-efficients outside the canal, and
in particular assumes the form

_dt[2]_ _−_ (dx[2]1 [+][ dx]2[2] [+][ dx]3[2][)][.]

Hence, outside the canal, the co-ordinates are fixed except for a
linear (Lorentz) transformation, and the t[k]i [’s vanish there. We as-]
sume that each of the “planes” t = const. has only a finite portion
of section in common with the canal. If we integrate the equations (56) with respect to x1, x2, x3 over such a plane, we find
that the quantities

�
_Ji =_ **U[0]i** _[dx][1]_ _[dx][2]_ _[dx][3]_

are independent of the time; that is _[dJ][i]_ = 0. We call J0 the

_dt_
**energy, and J1, J2, J3 the momentum co-ordinates of the**
system.
These quantities have a significance which is independent of
the co-ordinate system. We affirm, firstly, that they retain their
value if the co-ordinate system is changed anywhere within the
**canal. Let ¯xi be the new co-ordinates, identical with the old ones**
for the region outside the canal. We mark out two “surfaces”

_x0 = const. = a_ and _x¯0 = const. = ¯a_ (¯a ̸= a)

which do not intersect in the canal (for this it suffices to choose
_a and ¯a sufficiently different from one another)_ We can then

for x[∗]0 [=][ a][ and][ x][0] [= ¯][a][, then we get the result which we enunciated,]
namely, Ji = J[¯]i.
Consequently, the behaviour of the Ji’s need be investigated
only in the case of linear transformations of the co-ordinates.
With respect to such, however, the conception of a tensor with
components that are constant (that is, independent of position)
is invariant. We make use of an arbitrary vector p[i] of this type,
and form U[k] = U[k]i _[p][i][, and deduce from][ (56)][ that]_

By applying the same reasoning as was used above in the case of

energy-momentum vector is uniquely determined by the phase
(or state) of the physical system. The direction of this vector determines generally the direction in which the canal traverses the

**Whole**

The general theory of relativity leaves it quite undecided
whether the world-points may be represented by the values of
four co-ordinates xi in a singly reversible continuous manner or
not. It merely assumes that the neighbourhood of every worldpoint admits of a singly reversible continuous representation in
a region of the four-dimensional “number-space” (whereby “point
of the four-dimensional number-space” is to signify any numberquadruple); it makes no assumptions at the outset about the
inter-connection of the world. When, in the theory of surfaces,
we start with a parametric representation of the surface to be
investigated, we are referring only to a piece of the surface, not
to the whole surface, which in general can by no means be represented uniquely and continuously on the Euclidean plane or by a
plane region. Those properties of surfaces that persist during all
one-to-one continuous transformations form the subject-matter of
_analysis situs (the analysis of position); connectivity, for example,_
is a property of analysis situs. Every surface that is generated
from the sphere by continuous deformation does not, from the
point of view of analysis situs, differ from the sphere, but does
differ from an anchor-ring, for instance. For on the anchor-ring
there exist closed lines, which do not divide it into several regions,
whereas such lines are not to be found on the sphere. From the
geometry which is valid on a sphere, we derived “spherical geometry” (which, following Riemann, we set up in contrast with the
geometry of Bolyai-Lobatschefsky) by identifying two diametrically opposite points of the sphere. The resulting surface F is

imagine on a surface a small wheel in continual rotation in the
one direction to be moved along this surface during the rotation,
the centre of the wheel describing a closed curve, then we should
expect that when the wheel has returned to its initial position
it would rotate in the same direction as at the commencement
of its motion. If this is the case, then whatever curve the centre
of the wheel may have described on the surface, the latter is
called two-sided; in the reverse case, it is called one-sided. The
existence of one-sided surfaces was first pointed out by Möbius.
The surface F mentioned above is one-sided, whereas the sphere
is, of course, two-sided. This is obvious if the centre of the wheel
be made to describe a great circle; on the sphere the whole
circle must be traversed if this path is to be closed, whereas on F
only the half need be covered. Quite analogously to the case
of two-dimensional manifolds, four-dimensional ones may be endowed with diverse properties with regard to analysis situs. But
in every four-dimensional manifold the neighbourhood of a point
may, of course, be represented in a continuous manner by four
co-ordinates in such a way that different co-ordinate quadruples
always correspond to different points of this neighbourhood. The
use of the four world-co-ordinates is to be interpreted in just this
way.
Every world-point is the origin of the double-cone of the active future and the passive past. Whereas in the special theory
of relativity these two portions are separated by an intervening
region, it is certainly possible in the present case for the cone of
the active future to overlap with that of the passive past; so that,

the neighbourhood of a point which it has already once passed
through. The result would be a spectral image of the world more
fearful than anything the weird fantasy of E. T. A. Hoffmann has
ever conjured up. In actual fact the very considerable fluctuations
of the gik’s that would be necessary to produce this effect do not
occur in the region of world in which we live. Nevertheless there
is a certain amount of interest in speculating on these possibilities inasmuch as they shed light on the philosophical problem of
cosmic and phenomenal time. Although paradoxes of this kind
appear, nowhere do we find any real contradiction to the facts
directly presented to us in experience.
We saw in § 26 that, apart from the consideration of gravitation, the fundamental electrodynamic laws (of Mie) have a form
such as is demanded by the principle of causality. The timederivatives of the phase-quantities are expressed in terms of these
quantities themselves and their spatial differential co-efficients.
These facts persist when we introduce gravitation and thereby
increase the table of phase-quantities φi, Fik, by the gik’s and

�ik�
the ’s. But on account of the general invariance of physical
_r_

laws we must formulate our statements so that, from the values
of the phase-quantities for one moment, all those assertions concerning them, which have an invariant character, follow as
a consequence of physical laws; moreover, it must be noted that
this statement does not refer to the world as a whole but only to a
portion which can be represented by four co-ordinates. Following
Hilbert (vide note 29) we proceed thus. In the neighbourhood of


-----

,
_ds[2]_ = dx[2]0 _[−]_ [(][dx]1[2] [+][ dx]2[2] [+][ dx]3[2][)][.]

In the three-dimensional space x0 = 0 surrounding O we may
mark off a region R, such that, in it, −ds[2] remains definitely positive. Through every point of this region we draw the geodetic
world-line which is orthogonal to that region, and which has a
time-like direction. These lines will cover singly a certain fourdimensional neighbourhood of O. We now introduce new coordinates which will coincide with the previous ones in the threedimensional space R, for we shall now assign the co-ordinates
_x0, x1, x2, x3 to the point P at which we arrive, if we go from_
the point P0 = (x1, x2, x3) in R along the orthogonal geodetic
line passing through it, so far that the proper-time of the arc
traversed, P0P, is equal to x0. This system of co-ordinates was
introduced into the theory of surfaces by Gauss. Since ds[2] = dx[2]0
on each of the geodetic lines, we must get identically for all four
co-ordinates in this co-ordinate system:

_g00 = 1._ (58)

Since the lines are orthogonal to the three-dimensional space
_x0 = 0, we get for x0 = 0_

_g01 = g02 = g03 = 0._ (59)

Moreover, since the lines that are obtained when x1, x2, x3 are
kept constant and x0 is varied are geodetic, it follows (from the
equation of geodetic lines) that

�00�


-----

�00�

= 0.

_i_

Taking (58) into consideration, we get from the latter

_∂g0_
= 0 (i = 1, 2, 3)
_∂x0_

and, on account of (59), we have consequently not only for x0 = 0
but also identically for the four co-ordinates that

_g0i = 0_ (i = 1, 2, 3). (60)

The following picture presents itself to us: a family of geodetic lines with time-like direction which covers a certain worldregion singly and completely (without gaps); also, a similar uniparametric family of three-dimensional spaces x0 = const. According to (60) these two families are everywhere orthogonal to
one another, and all portions of arc cut off from the geodetic lines
by two of the “parallel” spaces x0 = const. have the same propertime. If we use this particular co-ordinate system, then

together with the electromagnetic quantities, as the unknowns,
we arrive at the required result (x0 playing the part of time).
The cone of the passive past starting from the point O[′] with a
positive x0 co-ordinate will cut a certain portion R[′] out of R,
which, with the sheet of the cone, will mark off a finite region of
the world G (namely, a conical cap with its vertex at O[′]). If our
assertion that the geodetic null-lines denote the initial points of
all action is rigorously true, then the values of the above twelve
quantities as well as the electromagnetic potentials φi and the
field-quantities Fik in the three-dimensional region of space R[′]

determine fully the values of the two latter quantities in the worldregion G. This has hitherto not been proved. In any case, we
_see that the differential equations of the field contain the physical_
_laws of nature in their complete form, and that there cannot be a_
further limitation due to boundary conditions at spatial infinity,
for example.
Einstein, arguing from cosmological considerations of the interconnection of the world as a whole (vide note 30) came to the conclusion that the world is finite in space. Just as in the Newtonian
theory of gravitation the law of contiguous action expressed in
Poisson’s equation entails the Newtonian law of attraction only if
the condition that the gravitational potential vanishes at infinity
is superimposed so Einstein in his theory seeks to supplement the


-----

y y g
of a general invariant character, which are in agreement with astronomical facts, he finds himself constrained to assume that the
world is closed with respect to space; for in this case the boundary conditions are absent. In consequence of the above remarks
the author cannot admit the cogency of this deduction, since the
differential equations in themselves, without boundary conditions,
contain the physical laws of nature in an unabbreviated form excluding every ambiguity. So much more weight is accordingly to
be attached to another consideration which arises from the question: How does it come about that our stellar system with the
relative velocities of the stars, which are extraordinarily small in
comparison with that of light, persists and maintains itself and
has not, even ages ago, dispersed itself into infinite space? This
system presents exactly the same view as that which a molecule
in a gas in equilibrium offers to an observer of correspondingly
small dimensions. In a gas, too, the individual molecules are not
at rest but the small velocities, according to Maxwell’s law of distribution, occur much more often than the large ones, and the
distribution of the molecules over the volume of the gas is, on the
average, uniform, so that perceptible differences of density occur
very seldom. If this analogy is legitimate, we could interpret the
state of the stellar system and its gravitational field according to
the same statistical principles that tell us that an isolated volume of gas is almost always in equilibrium. This would, however,
be possible only if the uniform distribution of stars at rest
**in a static gravitational field, as an ideal state of equilib-**
**rium, is reconcilable with the laws of gravitation. In a statical**
field of gravitation the world-line of a point-mass at rest, that is,

Therefore, a distribution of mass at rest is possible only if

_√_
_g00 = f = const. = 1._

The equation

∆f = [1] (µ = density of mass) (32)

2 _[µ]_


then shows, however, that the ideal state of equilibrium under
consideration is incompatible with the laws of gravitation, as
hitherto assumed.
In deriving the gravitational equations in § 28, however, we
committed a sin of omission. R is not the only invariant dependent
on the gik’s and their first and second differential co-efficients, and
which is linear in the latter; for the most general invariant of this
description has the form αR + β, in which α and β are numerical
constants. Consequently we may generalise the laws of gravitation
by replacing R by R+λ (and G by G+ [1]

2 _[λ][√][g][), in which][ λ][ denotes]_
a universal constant. If it is not equal to 0, as we have hitherto
assumed, we may take it equal to 1; by this means not only has the
unit of time been reduced by the principle of relativity to the unit
of length, and the unit of mass by the law of gravitation to the

coherent matter (T[0]0 [=][ µ][ =][ µ][0][√][g][, all other components of the]

_f = 1 and the notation of § 29:_

_λ = µ0_ [in place of (32)]

and
_Pik −_ _λγik = 0_ (i, k = 1, 2, 3). (61)

Hence this ideal state of equilibrium is possible under these circumstances if the mass is distributed with the density λ. The
space must then be homogeneous metrically; and indeed the equations (61) are then actually satisfied for a spherical space of radius
_a =_ �2/λ. Thus, in space, we may introduce four co-ordinates,

connected by
_x[2]1_ [+][ x]2[2] [+][ x]3[2] [+][ x]4[2] [=][ a][2][,] (62)

for which we get

_dσ[2]_ = dx[2]1 [+][ dx]2[2] [+][ dx]3[2] [+][ dx]4[2][.]

**From this we conclude that space is closed and hence**
**finite. If this were not the case, it would scarcely be possible to**
imagine how a state of statistical equilibrium could come about. If
the world is closed, spatially, it becomes possible for an observer to
see several pictures of one and the same star. These depict the star
at epochs separated by enormous intervals of time (during which
light travels once entirely round the world). We have yet to inquire
whether the points of space correspond singly and reversibly to the
value-quadruples xi which satisfy the condition (62), or whether

Thus our interpretation demands that the total mass that happens

The radially symmetrical solutions of the modified homogeneous equations of gravitation that would correspond to a world

world is a cylinder erected on this sphere in the direction of a
fifth co-ordinate axis t. But since on the “greatest sphere” x4 = 0,
which may be designated as the equator or the space-horizon for
that centre, f becomes zero, and hence the metrical groundform
of the world becomes singular, we see that the possibility of a stationary empty world is contrary to the physical laws that are here
regarded as valid. There must at least be masses at the horizon.
The calculation may be performed most readily if (merely to orient ourselves on the question) we assume an incompressible fluid
to be present there. According to § 32 the problem of variation

now yields a value of f that does not vanish at the equator. The
boundary condition of vanishing pressure gives a transcendental
relation between µ0 and r0, from which it follows that, if the masshorizon is to be taken arbitrarily small, then the fluid that comes
into question must have a correspondingly great density, namely,
such that the total mass does not become less than a certain

the new views of space and time bring within the realm of pos**sibility. The assumption on which they are based is at any rate**
the simplest on which it becomes explicable that, in the world
as actually presented to us, statical conditions obtain as a whole,
so far as the electromagnetic and the gravitational field is concerned, and that just those solutions of the statical equations are
valid which vanish at infinity or, respectively, converge towards
Euclidean metrics. For on the sphere these equations will have a
unique solution (boundary conditions do not enter into the question as they are replaced by the postulate of regularity over the
whole of the closed configuration). If we make the constant λ
arbitrarily small, the spherical solution converges to that which
satisfies at infinity the boundary conditions mentioned for the infinite world which results when we pass to the limit.
A metrically homogeneous world is obtained most simply
if, in a five-dimensional space with the metrical groundform
_ds[2]_ = −Ω(dx), (−Ω denotes a non-degenerate quadratic form
with constant co-efficients), we examine the four-dimensional

“conic-section” defined by the equation Ω(x) = [6] Thus this

_λ_ [.]
basis gives us a solution of the Einstein equations of gravitation,
modified by the λ term, for the case of no mass. If, as must be
the case, the resulting metrical groundform of the world is to have
one positive and three negative dimensions, we must take for Ω a
form with four positive dimensions and one negative, thus

Ω(x) = x[2]1 [+][ x]2[2] [+][ x]3[2] [+][ x]4[2] _[−]_ _[x]5[2][.]_

By means of a simple substitution this solution may easily be


-----

_x4 = z cosh t,_ _x5 = z sinh t,_


we get

_x[2]1_ [+] _[x]2[2]_ [+] _[x]3[2]_ [+] _[z][2][ =]_ [6] _−ds[2]_ = (dx[2]1 [+] _[dx]2[2]_ [+] _[dx]3[2]_ [+] _[dz][2][)]_ _[−]_ _[z][2][ dt][2][.]_

_λ_ _[,]_

These “new” z, t co-ordinates, however, enable only the “wedgeshaped” section x[2]4 _[−]_ _[x]5[2]_ _[>][ 0][ to be represented. At the “edge”]_
of the wedge (at which x4 = 0 simultaneously with x5 = 0),
_t becomes indeterminate._ This edge, which appears as a twodimensional configuration in the original co-ordinates is, therefore, three-dimensional in the new co-ordinates; it is the cylinder
erected in the direction of the t-axis over the equator z = 0 of the
sphere (65). The question arises whether it is the first or the second co-ordinate system that serves to represent the whole world
in a regular manner. In the former case the world would not be
static as a whole, and the absence of matter in it would be in
agreement with physical laws; de Sitter argues from this assumption (vide note 32). In the latter case we have a static world that
cannot exist without a mass-horizon; this assumption, which we
have treated more fully, is favoured by Einstein.

**§ 35. The Metrical Structure of the World as the Origin**
**of Electromagnetic Phenomena[∗]**

We now aim at a final synthesis. To be able to characterise
the physical state of the world at a certain point of it by means of
numbers we must not only refer the neighbourhood of this point to

sure. We wish to achieve just as fundamental a point of view with
regard to this second circumstance as is secured for the first one,
namely, the arbitrariness of the co-ordinate system, by the Einstein Theory that was described in the preceding paragraph. This
idea, when applied to geometry and the conception of distance (in
Chapter II) after the step from Euclidean to Riemann geometry
had been taken, effected the final entrance into the realm of infinitesimal geometry. Removing every vestige of ideas of “action
at a distance,” let us assume that world-geometry is of this kind;
we then find that the metrical structure of the world, besides being dependent on the quadratic form (1), is also dependent on a
linear differential form φi dxi.
Just as the step which led from the special to the general theory
of relativity, so this extension affects immediately only the worldgeometrical foundation of physics. Newtonian mechanics, as also
the special theory of relativity, assumed that uniform translation
is a unique state of motion of a set of vector axes, and hence that
the position of the axes at one moment determines their position
in all other moments. But this is incompatible with the intuitive
principle of the relativity of motion. This principle could be
satisfied, if facts are not to be violated drastically, only by maintaining the conception of infinitesimal parallel displacement of
a vector set of axes; but we found ourselves obliged to regard the
affine relationship, which determines this displacement, as something physically real that depends physically on the states of matter (“guiding field”). The properties of gravitation known from
experience, particularly the equality of inertial and gravitational
mass, teach us, finally, that gravitation is already contained in

important bearing on world-geometry to a significance which
is specifically physical. The same certainty that characterises the
relativity of motion accompanies the principle of the relativity of
**magnitude. We must not let our courage fail in maintaining this**
principle, according to which the size of a body at one moment
does not determine its size at another, in spite of the existence
of rigid bodies.[∗] But, unless we are to come into violent conflict with fundamental facts, this principle cannot be maintained
without retaining the conception of infinitesimal congruent transformation; that is, we shall have to assign to the world besides
its measure-determination at every point also a metrical relation_ship. Now this is not to be regarded as revealing a “geometrical”_
property which belongs to the world as a form of phenomena,
but as being a phase-field having physical reality. Hence, as the
fact of the propagation of action and of the existence of rigid
bodies leads us to found the affine relationship on the metrical
character of the world which lies a grade lower, it immediately
suggests itself to us, not only to identify the co-efficients of the
quadratic groundform gik dxi dxk with the potentials of the gravitational field, but also to identify the co-efficients of the lin**ear groundform φi dxi with the electromagnetic potentials.**
The electromagnetic field and the electromagnetic forces are then
derived from the metrical structure of the world or the metrics,
as we may call it. No other truly essential actions of forces are,

_∗It must be recalled in this connection that the spatial direction-picture_
which a point-eye with a given world-line receives at every moment from a
given region of the world, depends only on the ratios of the gik’s, inasmuch
as this is true of the geodetic null-lines which are the determining factors in

netic actions; for all the others statistical physics presents some
reasonable argument which traces them back to the above two by
the method of mean values. We thus arrive at the inference: The
**world is a (3 + 1)-dimensional metrical manifold; all phys-**
**ical field-phenomena are expressions of the metrics of the**
**world. (Whereas the old view was that the four-dimensional met-**
rical continuum is the scene of physical phenomena; the physical
essentialities themselves are, however, things that exist “in” this
world, and we must accept them in type and number in the form
in which experience gives us cognition of them: nothing further is
to be “comprehended” of them.) We shall use the phrase “state of
the world-æther” as synonymous with the word “metrical structure,” in order to call attention to the character of reality appertaining to metrical structure; but we must beware of letting this
expression tempt us to form misleading pictures. In this terminology the fundamental theorem of infinitesimal geometry states
that the guiding field, and hence also gravitation, is determined
by the state of the æther. The antithesis of “physical state” and
“gravitation” which was enunciated in § 28 and was expressed in
very clear terms by the division of Hamilton’s Function into two
parts, is overcome in the new view, which is uniform and logical
in itself. Descartes’ dream of a purely geometrical physics seems
to be attaining fulfilment in a manner of which he could certainly
have had no presentiment. The quantities of intensity are sharply
distinguished from those of magnitude.

Maxwell’s Theory the same result obtains for the electromagnetic

of Maxwell’s equations

is an intrinsic law, the validity of which is wholly independent of
whatever physical laws govern the series of values that the physical phase-quantities actually run through. In a four-dimensional
metrical manifold the simplest integral invariant that exists at all
is
� �
**l dx =** [1]4 _fikf_ _[ik]_ _dx_ (68)

and it is just this one, in the form of Action, on which Maxwell’s
Theory is founded! We have accordingly a good right to claim that
the whole fund of experience which is crystallised in Maxwell’s
Theory weighs in favour of the world-metrical nature of electricity. And since it is impossible to construct an integral invariant at
all of such a simple structure in manifolds of more or less than four
dimensions the new point of view does not only lead to a deeper
understanding of Maxwell’s Theory but the fact that the world
is four-dimensional, which has hitherto always been accepted as
merely “accidental,” becomes intelligible through it. In the linear
groundform φi dxi there is an arbitrary factor in the form of an
additive total differential, but there is not a factor of proportionality; the quantity Action is a pure number But this is only as it

(Quantum Theory), carries the greatest weight.
The statical case occurs when the co-ordinate system and the
calibration may be chosen so that the linear groundform becomes
equal to φ dx0 and the quadratic groundform becomes equal to

_f_ [2] _dx[2]0_ _[−]_ _[dσ][2][,]_

whereby φ and f are not dependent on the time x0, but only on
the space-co-ordinates x1, x2, x3, whilst dσ[2] is a definitely positive quadratic differential form in the three space-variables. This
particular form of the groundform (if we disregard quite particular cases) remains unaffected by a transformation of co-ordinates
and a re-calibration only if x0 undergoes a linear transformation
of its own, and if the space-co-ordinates are likewise transformed
only among themselves, whilst the calibration ratio must be a
constant. Hence, in the statical case, we have a three-dimensional
Riemann space with the groundform dσ[2] and two scalar fields
in it: the electrostatic potential φ, and the gravitational potential or the velocity of light f . The length-unit and the time-unit
(centimetre, second) are to be chosen as arbitrary units; dσ[2] has
dimensions cm[2], f has dimensions cm · sec[−][1], and φ has sec[−][1].
Thus, as far as one may speak of a space at all in the general
theory of relativity (namely, in the statical case), it appears as
a Riemann space, and not as one of the more general type, in
which the transference of distances is found to be non-integrable.
We have the case of the special theory of relativity again, if
the co-ordinates and the calibration may be chosen so that

except for a factor of proportionality, is equal to

_dx¯[2]0_ _[−]_ [(][d][x][¯]1[2] [+][ d][x][¯]2[2] [+][ d][x][¯]3[2][)][.]

The conformal transformations of the four-dimensional Minkowski
world coincide with spherical transformations (vide note 34), that
is, with those transformations which convert every “sphere” of the
world again into a sphere. A sphere is represented by a linear
homogeneous equation between the homogeneous “hexaspherical”
co-ordinates

_u0 : u1 : u2 : u3 : u4 : u5 = x0 : x1 : x2 : x3 : [(][x, x][) + 1]_ : [(][x, x][)][ −] [1],

To test whether the new hypothesis about the nature of the
electromagnetic field is able to account for phenomena, we must
work out its implications. We choose as our initial physical law
a Hamilton principle which states that the change in the Action

**W dx for every infinitely small variation of the metrical struc-**

ture of the world that vanishes outside a finite region is zero. The
_Action is an invariant, and hence W is a scalar-density (in the true_
sense) which is derived from the metrical structure. Mie, Hilbert,
and Einstein assumed the Action to be an invariant with respect
to transformations of the co-ordinates. We have here to add the
further limitation that it must also be invariant with respect to
the process of re-calibration, in which φi, gik are replaced by

in which λ is an arbitrary positive function of position. We assume
that W is an expression of the second order, that is, built up, on
the one hand, of the gik’s and their derivatives of the first and
second order, on the other hand, of the φi’s and their derivatives of
the first order. The simplest example is given by Maxwell’s density
_of action l. But we shall here carry out a general investigation_
without binding ourselves to any particular form of W at the
beginning. According to Klein’s method, used in § 28 (and which
will only now be applied with full effect), we shall here deduce

in the indices k and i is added. In the normalisation the δv[k]’s are
components of a vector-density (in the true sense), if the δφi’s

First of all, we express that **W dx is a calibration invariant,**

that is, that it does not alter when the calibration of the world is
altered infinitesimally. If the calibration ratio between the altered
and the original calibration is λ = 1 + π, π is an infinitesimal
scalar-field which characterises the event and which may be assigned arbitrarily. As a result of this process, the fundamental
quantities assume, according to (69), the following increments:

for π a function which vanishes for points outside X but is > 0
throughout X, then the first integral vanishes, but the second is
found to be positive—which contradicts equation (73). Now that

outside it, δ = 0, we get

If **W dx is the Action, we see from this that the following in-**

variant laws are contained in Hamilton’s Principle:

**w[i]** = 0, **Wi[k]** [= 0][.]

Of these, we have to call the former the electromagnetic laws,
the latter the gravitational laws. Between the left-hand sides of
these equations there are five identities, which have been stated
in (74) and (79). Thus there are among the field-equations five
superfluous ones corresponding to the transition (dependent on
five arbitrary functions) from one system of reference to another.
According to (752) the electromagnetic laws have the following
form:
_∂h[ik]_

= s[i] [and (67)] (82)
_∂xk_

in full agreement with Maxwell’s Theory; s[i] is the density of the
4-current, and the linear tensor-density of the second order h[ik]

is the electromagnetic density of field. Without specialising the
_Action at all we can read off the whole structure of Maxwell’s The-_
ory from the calibration invariance alone. The particular form of
Hamilton’s function W affects only the formulæ which state that
current and field-density are determined by the phase-quantities
_φi, gik of the æther. In the case of Maxwell’s Theory in the re-_
stricted sense (W = l), which is valid only in empty space, we get
**h[ik]** = f _[ik], s[i]_ = 0, which is as it should be.
Just as the s[i]’s constitute the density of the 4-current, so the
scheme of S[k]i [’s is to be interpreted as the pseudo-tensor-density of]
the energy. In the simplest case, W = l, this explanation becomes

conservation may, by (75) and (80), be summarised conveniently
in the two equations

Attention has already been directed above to the intimate connection between the laws of conservation of the energy-momentum
and the co-ordinate-invariance. To these four laws there is to be
added the law of conservation of electricity, and, corresponding to
it, there must, logically, be a property of invariance which will introduce a fifth arbitrary function; the calibration-invariance here
appears as such. Earlier we derived the law of conservation of
energy-momentum from the co-ordinate-invariance only owing to
the fact that Hamilton’s function consists of two parts, the Ac_tion-function of the gravitational field and that of the “physical_
phase”; each part had to be treated differently, and the component
results had to be combined appropriately (§ 33). If those quantities which are derived from Wξ[k] + δv[k] by taking the variation of

the energy-momentum components of the twofold action-function
which have been used as a basis since § 28. For the gravitational
component (W = G) we defined the energy by means of _[∗]S[k]i_
(§ 33), but for the electromagnetic component (W = L, § 28) we
introduced Wi[k] [as the energy components. This second compo-]
nent L contains only the gik’s themselves, not their derivatives;
for a quantity of this kind we have, by (802), Wi[k] [=][ S]i[k][. Hence (][if]
**we use the transformations which the fundamental quan-**
**tities undergo during an infinitesimal alteration of the**
**calibration), we can adapt the two different definitions of energy**
to one another although we cannot reconcile them entirely. These
discrepancies are removed only here since it is the new theory
which first furnishes us with an explanation of the current s[i], of
the electromagnetic density of field h[ik], and of the energy S[k]i [,]
which is no longer bound by the assumption that the Action is
composed of two parts, of which the one does not contain the φi’s
and their derivatives, and the other does not contain the derivatives of the g[ik]’s. The virtual deformation of the world-continuum
which leads to the definition of S[k]i [must, accordingly, carry along]
the metrical structure and the line-elements “unchanged” in our
sense and not in that of Einstein. The laws of conservation of
the s[i]’s and the S[k]i [’s are then likewise not bound by an assumption]
concerning the composition of the Action. Thus, after the total
energy had been introduced in § 33, we have once again passed
beyond the stand taken in § 28 to a point of view which gives a

gravitational matter, namely, that it recognises their identity as
necessary but not as a consequence of an undiscovered law of physical nature, is accomplished by the present theory with respect to
the facts that find expression in the structure of Maxwell’s equations and the laws of conservation. Just as is the case in § 33 in
which we integrate over the cross-section of a canal of the system,
so we find here that, as a result of the laws of conservation, if
the s[i]’s and S[k]i [’s vanish outside the canal, the system has a con-]
stant charge e and a constant energy-momentum J. Both may
be represented, by Maxwell’s equations (82) and the gravitational
equations (81), as the flux of a certain spatial field through a surface Ω that encloses the system. If we regard this representation
as a definition, the integral theorems of conservation hold, even if
the field has a real singularity within the canal of the system. To
prove this, let us replace this field within the canal in any arbitrary way (preserving, of course, a continuous connection with the
region outside it) by a regular field, and let us define the s[i]’s and
the S[k]i [’s by the equations][ (82)][,][ (81)][ (in which the right-hand sides]
are to be replaced by zero) in terms of the quantities h and H
belonging to the altered field. The integrals of these fictitious
quantities s[0] and S[0]i [, which are to be taken over the cross-section]
of the canal (the interior of Ω), are constant; on the other hand,
they coincide with the fluxes mentioned above over the surface Ω,
since on Ω the imagined field coincides with the real one.

We have now to show that if we uphold our new theory it is
possible to make an assumption about W which, as far as the results that have been confirmed in experience are concerned, agrees
with Einstein’s Theory. The simplest assumption[∗] for purposes of
calculation (I do not insist that it is realised in nature) is:

**W = −** [1] (83)

4 _[F][ 2][√][g][ +][ α][l][.]_


The quantity Action is thus to be composed of the volume, measured in terms of the radius of curvature of the world as unit of
length (cf. (62), § 17) and of Maxwell’s action of the electromagnetic field; the positive constant α is a pure number. It follows
that
_δW = −_ [1] [1]

This normalisation denotes that we are measuring with cosmic

that points of the world whose co-ordinates differ by amounts of
the order of magnitude 1, are separated by cosmic distances, then
we may assume that the gik’s and the φi’s are of the order of magnitude 1. (It is, of course, a fact that the potentials vary perceptibly by amounts that are extraordinarily small in comparison with
cosmic distances.) By means of the substitution xi = ϵx[′]i [we intro-]

must be a pre-established harmony between the universal physical constant λ that occurs in it, and the total mass of the earth
(because each of these quantities in themselves already determine
the curvature of the world), here (where λ denotes merely the
curvature), we have that the mass present in the world deter**mines the curvature.** It seems to the author that just this is
what makes Einstein’s cosmology physically possible. In the case
in which a physical field is present, Einstein’s cosmological term

The statical world is by its own nature calibrated. The question arises whether F = const. for this calibration. The answer is
in the affirmative. For if we re-calibrate the statical world in accordance with the postulate F = −1 and distinguish the resulting

As a result of the normalisations that have been performed, the
spatial co-ordinate system is fixed except for a Euclidean rotation,
and hence h[2] is uniquely determined. In f and φ, as a result of
the free choice of the unit of time, a common constant factor
remains arbitrary (a circumstance that may be used to reduce
the order of the problem by 1). If the equator of the space is
reached when r = r0, then the quantities that occur as functions
of z = �r0[2] _[−]_ _[r][2][ must exhibit the following behaviour for][ z][ = 0][:]_

_f and φ are regular, and f ̸= 0; h[2]_ is infinite to the second order,

If diametral points are to be identified, φ must be an even function
of z, and the solution is uniquely determined by the initial values
for z = 0, which satisfy the given conditions (vide note 37). It
cannot remain regular in the whole region 0 ≤ _r ≤_ _r0, but must,_
if we let r decrease from r0, have a singularity at least ultimately
when r = 0. For otherwise it would follow, by multiplying the

Matter is accordingly a true singularity of the field. The fact that
the phase-quantities vary appreciably in regions whose linear di
mensions are very small in comparison with _√[1]_ may be explained,

perhaps, by the circumstance that a value must be taken for r0[2]
which is enormously great in comparison with [1]

_λ_ [. The fact that]
all elementary particles of matter have the same charge and the
same mass seems to be due to the circumstance that they are all
embedded in the same world (of the same radius r0); this agrees
with the idea developed in § 32, according to which the charge and
the mass are determined from infinity.
In conclusion we shall set up the mechanical equations that

the point of view of the general theory of relativity; we shall now
endeavour to make good this omission. We shall also take this
opportunity of carrying out the intention stated in § 32, that is,
to show that in general the inertial mass is the flux of the gravitational field through a surface which encloses the particle, even
when the matter has to be regarded as a singularity which limits
the field and lies, so to speak, outside it. In doing this we are, of
course, debarred from using a substance which is in motion; the
hypotheses corresponding to the latter idea, namely (§ 27):

_dm ds = µ dx,_ **T[k]i** [=][ µu][i][u][k]

are quite impossible here, as they contradict the postulated properties of invariance. For, according to the former equation, µ is
a scalar-density of weight [1]

2 [, and, according to the latter, one of]
weight 0, since T[k]i [is a tensor-density in the true sense. And we]
see that these initial conditions are impossible in the new theory
for the same reason as in Einstein’s Theory, namely, because they
lead to a false value for the mass, as was mentioned at the end
of § 33. This is obviously intimately connected with the circum
�
stance that the integral _dm ds has now no meaning at all, and_

hence cannot be introduced as “substance-action of gravitation”.
We took the first step towards giving a real proof of the mechanical equations in § 33. There we considered the special case in
which the body is completely isolated, and no external forces act
on it.
From this we see at once that we must start from the laws of
conservation

world, in the interior of which the current filament of the material
particle flows along. Let the co-ordinate system consisting of the
“time-co-ordinate” x0 = t and the “space-co-ordinates” x1, x2, x3,
be such that the spaces x0 = const. intersect the canal (the crosssection is the volume Ω mentioned above). The integrals

which are to be taken in a space x0 = const. over Ω, and which
are functions of the time alone, represent the energy (i = 0) and
the momentum (i = 1, 2, 3) of the material particle. If we integrate the equation (89) in the space x0 = const. over Ω, the

first member (k = 0) gives the time-derivative _[dJ]dt[i]_ [; the integral]

sum over the three last terms, however, becomes transformed by
Gauss’ Theorem into an integral Ki which is to be taken over the

deed, be defined in the above manner, and then the device of the
“fictitious field,” used at the end of § 35, leads to the mechanical
equations proved above. It is of fundamental importance to notice
_that in them only such quantities are brought into relationship with_
_one another as are determined by the course of the field outside_
_the particle (on the surface of Ω), and have nothing to do with the_
_singular states or phases in its interior. The antithesis of kinetic_
and potential which receives expression in the fundamental law
of mechanics does not, indeed, depend actually on the separation
of energy-momentum into one part belonging to the external field
and another belonging to the particle (as we pictured it in § 25),
but rather on this juxtaposition, conditioned by the resolution
into space and time, of the first and the three last members of
the divergence equations which make up the laws of conservation,
that is, on the circumstance that the singularity canals of the material particles have an infinite extension in only one dimension,
but are very limited in three other dimensions. This stand was
taken most definitely by Mie in the third part of his epoch-making
_Foundations of a Theory of Matter, which deals with “Force and_
Inertia” (vide note 38). Our next object is to work out the full
consequences of this view for the principle of action adopted in
this chapter.
To do this, it is necessary to ascertain exactly the meaning of
the electromagnetic and the gravitational equations. If we discuss
Maxwell’s equations first, we may disregard gravitation entirely
and take the point of view presented by the special theory of
relativity. We should be reverting to the notion of substance if we

so literally as to apply it to the volume-elements of an electron. Its
true meaning is rather this: Outside the Ω-canal, the homogeneous
equations
_∂f_ _[ik]_

_∂xk_

hold. The only statical radially symmetrical solution _f[¯][ik]_ of (91)
is that derived from the potential _[e]_

_r_ [; it gives the flux][ e][ (and not][ 0][,]

as it would be in the case of a solution of (91) which is free from
singularities) of the electric field through an envelope Ω enclosing
the particle. On account of the linearity of equations (91), these
properties are not lost when an arbitrary solution fik of equations (91), free from singularities, is added to _f[¯]ik; such a one is_
given by fik = const. The field which surrounds the moving
**electron must be of the type: fik + f[¯]ik, if we introduce at**
the moment under consideration a co-ordinate system in which
the electron is at rest. This assumption concerning the constitution of the field outside Ω is, of course, justified only when we
are dealing with quasi-stationary motion, that is, when the worldline of the particle deviates by a sufficiently small amount from a
straight line. The term ρu[i] in Lorentz’s equation is to express the
general effect of the charge-singularities for a region that contains
many electrons. But it is clear that this assumption comes into
question only for quasi-stationary motion. Nothing at all can
be asserted about what happens during rapid acceleration The


-----

particle emits radiation, seems to the author quite unfounded. It
is justified only if Lorentz’s equations are interpreted in the too
literal fashion repudiated above, and if, also, it is assumed that
the constitution of the electron is not modified by the acceleration. Bohr’s Theory of the Atom has led to the idea that
there are individual stationary orbits for the electrons circulating in the atom, and that they may move permanently in these
orbits without emitting radiations; only when an electron jumps
from one stationary orbit to another is the energy that is lost
by the atom emitted as electromagnetic energy of vibration (vide
note 39). If matter is to be regarded as a boundary-singularity of
the field, our field-equations make assertions only about the pos**sible states of the field, and not about the conditioning**
**of the states of the field by the matter. This gap is filled**
by the Quantum Theory in a manner of which the underlying
principle is not yet fully grasped. The above assumption about
the singular component _f[¯] of the field surrounding the particle is,_
in our opinion, true for a quasi-stationary electron. We may, of
course, work out other assumptions. If, for example, the particle
is a radiating atom, the _f[¯][ik]’s will have to be represented as the_
field of an oscillating Hertzian dipole. (This is a possible state of
the field which is caused by matter in a manner which, according
to Bohr, is quite different from that imagined by Hertz.)
As far as gravitation is concerned, we shall for the present
adopt the point of view of the original Einstein Theory. In it the
(homogeneous) gravitational equations have (according to § 31) a
statical radially symmetrical solution, which depends on a single
**constant m, the mass. The flux of a gravitational field through**

, g,
but equal to m. We assume that this solution is characteristic of
the moving particle in the following sense: We consider the values
traversed by the gik’s outside the canal to be extended over the
canal, by supposing the narrow deep furrow, which the path of
the material particle cuts out in the metrical picture of the world,
to be smoothed out, and by treating the stream-filament of the
particle as a line in this smoothed-out metrical field. Let ds be the
corresponding proper-time differential. For a point of the streamfilament we may introduce a (“normal”) co-ordinate system such
that, at that point,

_ds[2]_ = dx[2]0 _[−]_ [(][dx]1[2] [+][ dx]2[2] [+][ dx]3[2][)][,]

the derivatives _[∂g][αβ]_ vanish, and the direction of the stream
_∂xi_

filament is given by

_dx0 : dx1 : dx2 : dx3 = 1 : 0 : 0 : 0._

In terms of these co-ordinates the field is to be expressed by
the above-mentioned statical solution (only, of course, in a certain neighbourhood of the world-point under consideration, from
which the canal of the particle is to be cut out). If we regard
the normal co-ordinates xi as Cartesian co-ordinates in a fourdimensional Euclidean space, then the picture of the world-line
of the particle becomes a definite curve in the Euclidean space.
Our assumption is, of course, admissible again only if the motion
is quasi-stationary, that is, if this picture-curve is only slightly
curved at the point under consideration. (The transformation of

account of the singularities, due to the presence of masses, by fusing them into a continuum; this assumption is legitimate only in
the quasi-stationary case.)

shall use, once and for all, the calibration normalised by F =
const., and we shall neglect the cosmological terms outside the
canal. The influence of the charge of the electron on the gravitational field is, as we know from § 32, to be neglected in comparison with the influence of the mass, provided the distance from
the particle is sufficiently great. Consequently, if we base our calculations on the normal co-ordinate system, we may assume the
gravitational field to be that mentioned above. The determination
of the electromagnetic field is then, as in the gravitational case, a
linear problem; it is to have the form fik + f[¯]ik mentioned above
(with fik = const. on the surface of Ω). But this assumption is
compatible with the field-laws only if e = const. To prove this,
we shall deduce from a fictitious field that fills the canal regularly
and that links up with the really existing field outside, that

_∂f_ _[ik]_ �

= s[i], **s[0]** _dx1 dx2 dx3 = e[∗]_
_∂xk_ Ω


in any arbitrary co-ordinate system; e[∗] is independent of the choice
of the fictitious field, inasmuch as it may be represented as a fieldflux through the surface of Ω. Since (if we neglect the cosmological
terms) the s[i]’s on this surface vanish, the equation of definition

gives us, if _[∂][s][i]_ = 0 is integrated, _[de][∗]_

_∂xi_ _dt_ [= 0][; moreover, the argu-]

ments set out in § 33 show that e[∗] is independent of the co ordinate

Passing on from the charge to the momentum, we must notice
at once that, with regard to the representation of the energymomentum components by means of field-fluxes, we may not refer
to the general theory of § 35, because, by applying the process of
partial integration to arrive at (84), we sacrificed the co-ordinate
invariance of our Action. Hence we must proceed as follows. With
the help of the fictitious field which bridges the canal regularly,
we define αS[k]i [by means of]

(R[k]i _[−]_ 2[1] _[δ]i[k][R][) +]_ **Gδi[k]** _[−]_ 2[1] _∂xi_ **G[αβ,k]** _._


The equation
_∂S[k]i_ = 0 (92)
_∂xk_

is an identity for it. By integrating (92) we get (90), whereby

is to be calculated along the lines of Maxwell. Since the components of Maxwell’s energy-density depend quadratically on the
field f + f[¯], each of them is composed of three terms in accordance
with the formula

(f + f[¯])[2] = f [2] + 2ff[¯] + f[¯][2].

In the case of each, the first term contributes nothing, since the
flux of a constant vector through a closed surface is 0. The last
term is to be neglected since it contains the weak field _f[¯] as a_
square; the middle term alone remains. But this gives us

_Ki = ef0i._

Concerning the momentum-quantities we see (in the same way
as in § 33, by using identities (92) and treating the cross-section
of the stream-filament as infinitely small in comparison with the
external field) (1) that, for co-ordinate transformations that are
to be regarded as linear in the cross-section of the canal, the Ji’s
are the co-variant components of a vector which is independent
of the co-ordinate system; and (2) that if we alter the fictitious
field occupying the canal (in § 33 we were concerned, not with
this, but with a charge of the co-ordinate system in the canal)
the quantities Ji retain their values. In the normal co-ordinate
system, however, for which the gravitational field that surrounds
the particle has the form calculated in § 31, we find that, since
the fictitious field may be chosen as a statical one, according to
page 408: J1 = J2 = J3 = 0, and J0 = the flux of a spatial vectordensity through the surface of Ω and hence _m On account of_

Hence the equations of motion of our particle expressed in the

The 0th of these equations gives us: _[dm]_

_dt_ [= 0][; thus the field equa-]

_ds_ _−_ [1]2 _∂xi_ _mu[α]u[β]_ = e · fkiu[k]. (94)


For the relations (94) are invariant with respect to co-ordinate
transformations, and agree with (93) in the case of the normal coordinate system. Hence, according to the field-laws, a necessary
_condition for a singularity canal, which is to fit into the remaining_
_part of the field, and in the immediate neighbourhood of which the_
_field has the required structure, is that the quantities e and m_
_that characterise the singularity at each point of the canal remain_

In the light of these considerations it seems to the author that


-----

p,
view of matter assumes a fantastic, unreal complexion. It was,
of course, a natural result of the special theory of relativity that
we should come to this conclusion. It is only when we arrive at
the general theory that we find it possible to represent the mass
as a field-flux, and to ascribe to the world relationships such as
obtain in Einstein’s Cylindrical World (§ 34), when there are cut
out of it canals of circular cross-section which stretch to infinity in
both directions. This view of m states not only that inertial and
gravitational masses are identical in nature, but also that mass
as the point of attack of the metrical field is identical in nature
with mass as the generator of the metrical field. That which is
physically important in the statement that energy has inertia still
persists in spite of this. For example, a radiating particle loses
inertial mass of exactly the same amount as the electromagnetic
energy that it emits. (In this example Einstein first recognised
the intimate relationship between energy and inertia.) This may
be proved simply and rigorously from our present point of view.
Moreover, the new standpoint in no wise signifies a relapse to
the old idea of substance, but it deprives of meaning the problem of the cohesive pressure that holds the charge of the electron
together.
With about the same reasonableness as is possessed by Einstein’s Theory we may conclude from our results that a clock in

responds to the normalisation F = const.[∗] If during the motion

distance traversed by it during a period were to be transferred congruently from period to period in the sense of our world-geometry,
then two clocks which set out from the same world-point A with
the same period, that is, which traverse congruent world-distances
in A during their first period will have, in general, different periods
when they meet at a later world-point B. The orbital motion of
the electrons in the atom can, therefore, certainly not take place
in the way described, independently of their previous histories,
since the atoms emit spectral lines of definite frequencies. Neither
does a measuring rod at rest in a statical field undergo a congruent transference; for the measure l = dσ[2] of a measuring rod at
rest does not alter, whereas for a congruent transference it would

have to satisfy the equation _[dl]_

_dt_ [=][ −][l] _[·][φ][. What is the source of this]_
discrepancy between the conception of congruent transference and
the behaviour of measuring rods, clocks, and atoms? We may distinguish two modes of determining a quantity in nature, namely,
that of persistence and that of adjustment. This difference is
illustrated in the following example. We may prescribe to the axis
of a rotating top any arbitrary direction in space; but once this
arbitrary initial direction has been fixed the direction of the axis
of the top when left to itself is determined from it for all time by
a tendency of persistence which is active from one moment to
another; at each instant the axis experiences an infinitesimal par
potentials at all. For this reason the inference made in our calculation of
the displacement towards the infra-red (page 367), that similar atoms
radiate the same frequency measured in the proper time ds corresponding to
the normalisation F = const., is by no means as convincing as in the theory

magnet needle in the magnetic field. Its direction is determined at
every moment, independently of the state of the system at other
moments, by the fact that the system, in virtue of its constitution,
**adjusts itself to the field in which it is embedded. There is no**
_a priori ground for supposing a pure transference, following the_
tendency of persistence, to be integrable. But even if this be the
case, as, for example, for rotations of the top in Euclidean space,
nevertheless two tops which set out from the same point with axes
in the same position, and which meet after the lapse of a great
length of time, will manifest any arbitrary deviations in the positions of the axes, since they can never be fully removed from all
influences. Thus although, for example, Maxwell’s equations for
the charge e of an electron make necessary the equation of conser
vation _[de]_

_dt_ [= 0][, this does not explain why an electron itself after]
an arbitrarily long time still has the same charge, and why this
charge is the same for all electrons. This circumstance shows that
the charge is determined not by persistence but by adjustment:
there can be only one state of equilibrium of negative electricity, to which the corpuscle adjusts itself afresh at every moment.
The same reason enables us to draw the same conclusion for the
spectral lines of the atoms, for what is common to atoms emitting
equal frequencies is their constitution and not the equality of their
frequencies at some moment when they were together far back in
time. In the same way, obviously, the length of a measuring rod
is determined by adjustment; for it would be impossible to give
to this rod at this point of the field any length, say two or three
times as great as the one that it now has, in the way that I can
b d b l h ld k


-----

y p g y j
consequence of its constitution the rod assumes a length which
has such and such a value in relation to the radius of curvature of
the world. (Perhaps the time of rotation of a top gives us an example of a time-length that is determined by persistence; if what
we assumed above is true for direction then at each moment of
the motion of the top the rotation vector would experience a parallel displacement.) We may briefly summarise as follows: The
affine and metrical relationship is an a priori datum telling us
how vectors and lengths alter, if they happen to follow the
**tendency of persistence. But to what extent this is the case in**
nature, and in what proportion persistence and adjustment modify one another, can be found only by starting from the physical
laws that hold, i.e. from the principle of action.
The subject of the above discussion is the principle of action,
compatible with the new axiom of calibration invariance, which
most nearly approaches the Maxwell-Einstein theory. We have
seen that it accounts equally well for all the phenomena which
are explained by the latter theory and, indeed, that it has decided
advantages so far as the deeper problems, such as the cosmological
problems and that of matter are concerned. Nevertheless, I doubt
whether the Hamiltonian function (83) corresponds to reality. We
may certainly assume that W has the form W _[√]g, in which W is_
an invariant of weight −2 formed in a perfectly rational manner
from the components of curvature. Only four of these invariants
may be set up, from which every other may be built up linearly
by means of numerical co-efficients (vide note 40). One of these
is Maxwell’s:
_l =_ [1] (95)

to the same law by which (95), the square of the numerical value,
is produced from the distance-curvature fik we may form

1 (96)
4 _[F][ik][F][ ik]_

from the total curvature. The multiplication is in this case to
be interpreted as a composition of matrices; (96) is therefore itself again a matrix. But its trace L is a scalar of weight −2.
The two quantities L and l seem to be invariant and of the kind
sought, and they can be formed most naturally from the curvature; invariants of this natural and simple type, indeed, exist only
in a four-dimensional world at all. It seems more probable that
_W is a linear combination of L and l. Maxwell’s equations be-_
come then as above: (when the calibration has been normalised
by F = const.) s[i] = a constant multiple of _[√]gφ[i], and h[ik]_ = f _[ik]._
The gravitational laws in the statical case here, too, agree to a first
approximation with Newton’s laws. Calculations by Pauli (vide
note 41) have indeed disclosed that the field determined in § 31
is not only a rigorous solution of Einstein’s equations, but also of
those favoured here, so that the amount by which the perihelion
of Mercury’s orbit advances and the amount of the deflection of
light rays owing to the proximity of the sun at least do not conflict
with these equations. But in the question of the mechanical equations and of the relationship holding between the results obtained
by measuring-rods and clocks on the one hand and the quadratic
form on the other, the connecting link with the old theory seems
to be lost; here we may expect to meet with new results.
**One serious objection may be raised against the theory in its**

of action a square root or some other irrationality; in the discussion on Mie’s theory, it was mentioned how the desired inequality
could be caused in this way, but it was also pointed out what obstacles lie in the way of such an irrational Action. Or, secondly,
there is the following view which seems to the author to give a
truer statement of reality. We have here occupied ourselves only
with the field which satisfies certain generally invariant functional
laws. It is quite a different matter to inquire into the excitation
or cause of the field-phases that appear to be possible according
to these laws; it directs our attention to the reality lying beyond
the field. Thus in the æther there may exist convergent as well
as divergent electromagnetic waves; but only the latter event can
be brought about by an atom, situated at the centre, which emits
energy owing to the jump of an electron from one orbit to another in accordance with Bohr’s hypothesis. This example shows
(what is immediately obvious from other considerations) that the
idea of causation (in contra-distinction to functional relation) is
intimately connected with the unique direction of progress
**characteristic of Time, namely Past →** **Future. This one-**
ness of sense in Time exists beyond doubt—it is, indeed, the most
fundamental fact of our perception of Time—but a priori reasons
exclude it from playing a part in physics of the field, But we saw
above (§ 33) that the sign, too, of an isolated system is fully determined, as soon as a definite sense of flow, Past → Future, has
been prescribed to the world-canal swept out by the system. This
connects the inequality of positive and negative electricity with
the inequality of Past and Future; but the roots of this problem
are not in the field, but lie outside it. Examples of such regulari

boundaries of the field: by our assumptions above concerning the
constitution of the field in their immediate neighbourhood: lastly,
and above all, by the facts of the quantum theory. But the way
in which these regularities have hitherto been formulated are, of
course, merely provisional in character. Nevertheless, it seems
that the theory of statistics plays a part in it which is fundamentally necessary. We must here state in unmistakable language
that physics at its present stage can in no wise be regarded as
lending support to the belief that there is a causality of physical
nature which is founded on rigorously exact laws. The extended
field, “æther,” is merely the transmitter of effects and is, of itself,
powerless; it plays a part that is in no wise different from that
which space with its rigid Euclidean metrical structure plays, according to the old view; but now the rigid motionless character
has become transformed into one which gently yields and adapts
itself. But freedom of action in the world is no more restricted by
the rigorous laws of field physics than it is by the validity of the
laws of Euclidean geometry according to the usual view.
If Mie’s view were correct, we could recognise the field as objective reality, and physics would no longer be far from the goal of
giving so complete a grasp of the nature of the physical world, of
matter, and of natural forces, that logical necessity would extract
from this insight the unique laws that underlie the occurrence of
physical events. For the present, however, we must reject these
bold hopes. The laws of the metrical field deal less with reality itself than with the shadow-like extended medium that serves
as a link between material things, and with the formal constitution of this medium that gives it the power of transmitting

field physics; but the problem of matter is still wrapt in deepest
gloom. But even if we recognise the limited range of field physics,
we must gratefully acknowledge the insight to which it has helped
us. Whoever looks back over the ground that has been traversed,
leading from the Euclidean metrical structure to the mobile metrical field which depends on matter, and which includes the field
phenomena of gravitation and electromagnetism; whoever endeavours to get a complete survey of what could be represented only
successively and fitted into an articulate manifold, must be overwhelmed by a feeling of freedom won—the mind has cast off the
fetters which have held it captive. He must feel transfused with
the conviction that reason is not only a human, a too human,
makeshift in the struggle for existence, but that, in spite of all
disappointments and errors, it is yet able to follow the intelligence which has planned the world, and that the consciousness of
each one of us is the centre at which the One Light and Life of
Truth comprehends itself in Phenomena. Our ears have caught a
few of the fundamental chords from that harmony of the spheres
of which Pythagoras and Kepler once dreamed.

(Pp. 266 and 341)

To distinguish “normal” co-ordinate systems among all others
in the special theory of relativity, and to determine the metrical
groundform in the general theory, we may dispense with not only
rigid bodies but also with clocks.
In the special theory of relativity the postulate that, for the
transformation corresponding to the co-ordinates xi of a piece
of the world to an Euclidean “picture” space, the world-lines of
points moving freely under no forces are to become straight lines

holds. This is immediately evident if, in Möbius’ mesh construction (Fig. 12), we replace infinity by a straight line intersecting
our portion of space (Fig. 15). The phenomenon of light propagation then fixes infinity and the metrical structure in our four

are projections, taken from different world-points, of one and the
same two-dimensional conic section situated in E.
In the general theory of relativity these deductions are best
expressed in the following form. The four-dimensional Riemann
space, which Einstein imagines the world to be, is a particular
case of general metrical space (§ 16). If we adopt this view we
may say that the phenomenon of light propagation determines
the quadratic groundform ds[2], whereas the linear one remains
unrestricted. Two different choices of the linear groundform which
differ by dφ = φi dxi correspond to two different values of the affine
relationship. Their difference is, according to formula (49), § 16,
given by

[Γ[i]αβ[] =] [1]2 [(][δ]α[i] _[φ][β]_ [+][ δ]β[i] _[φ][α]_ _[−]_ _[g][αβ][φ][i][)][.]_

The difference between the two vectors that are derived from a
world-vector u[i] at the world-point O by means of an infinitesimal parallel displacement of u[i] in its own direction (by the same
amount dxi = ϵ · u[i]), is therefore ϵ times

_u[i](φαu[α]) −_ [1]2 _[φ][i][,]_ (∗)

whereby we assume gαβu[α]u[β] = 1. If the geodetic lines passing
through O in the direction of the vector u[i] coincide for the two
fields, then the above two vectors derived from u[i] by parallel displacement must be coincident in direction; the vector (∗), and
hence φ[i], must have the same direction as the vector u[i]. If this
agreement holds for two geodetic lines passing through O in different directions, we get φ[i] = 0. Hence if we know the world-lines
of two point-masses passing through O and moving only under
the influence of the guiding field then the linear groundform as

_Proof of the Theorem that, in Riemann’s space, R is the sole_
_invariant that contains the derivatives of the gik’s only to the sec-_
_ond order, and those of the second order only linearly._
According to hypothesis, the invariant J is built up of the
derivatives of the second order:

_∂[2]gik_
_gik,rs =_ ;
_∂xr ∂xs_

thus
�
_J =_ _λik,rsgik,rs + λ._

The λ’s denote expressions in the gik’s and their first derivatives;
they satisfy the conditions of symmetry:

_λki,rs = λik,rs,_ _λik,sr = λik,rs._

At the point O at which we are considering the invariant, we
introduce an orthogonal geodetic co-ordinate system, so that, at
that point, we have

_∂gik_
_gik = δi[k][,]_ = 0.

_∂xr_

The λ’s become absolute constants, if these values are inserted.
The unique character of the co-ordinate system is not affected by:
(1) linear orthogonal transformations;
(2) a transformation of the type


-----

q ; y
metrical in k, r, and s, but are otherwise arbitrary.
Let us therefore consider in a Euclidean-Cartesian space (in
which arbitrary orthogonal linear transformations are allowable)
the biquadratic form dependent on two vectors x = (xi), y = (yi),
namely
_G = gik,rsxixkyrys_
with arbitrary co-efficients gik,rs that are symmetrical in i and k,
as also in r and s; then

_λik,rsgik,rs_ (1)

must be an invariant of this form. Moreover, since as a result
of the transformation (2) above, the derivatives gik,rs transform
themselves, as may easily be calculated, according to the equation

_gik,rs[′]_ [=][ g][ik,rs] [+] [1]2 [(][α]krs[i] [+][ α]irs[k] [)][,]

we must have
_λik,rsαkrs[i]_ [= 0] (2)

for every system of numbers α symmetrical in the three indices
_k, r, s._
Let us operate further in the Euclidean-Cartesian space;
(x, y) is to signify the scalar product x1y1 + x2y2 + . . . + xnyn. It
will suffice to use for G a form of the type

_G = (a, x)[2](b, y)[2]_

in which a and b denote arbitrary vectors. If we now again write
_x and y for a and b, then (1) expresses the postulate that_


-----

g, y ( )
sufficient to choose
_αkrs[i]_ [=][ x][i] _[·][ y][k][y][r][y][s]_

and then this postulate signifies that the form which is derived
from Λx by converting an x into a y, namely,

Λy = � _λik,rsxiykyrys_ (2[∗])

vanishes identically. (It is got from Λx by forming first the symmetrical bilinear form Λx,x′ in x, x[′] (it is related quadratically
to y), which, if the series of variables x[′] be identified with x, resolves into Λx, and by then replacing x[′] by y.) I now assert that
it follows from (1[∗]) that Λ is of the form

Λ = α(x, x)(y, y) − _β(x, y)[2]_ (I)

and from (2[∗]) that
_α = β._ (II)

This will be the complete result, for then we shall have

_J = α(gii,kk −_ _gik,ik) + λ_

or since, in an orthogonal geodetic co-ordinate system, the Riemann scalar of curvature is

_R = gik,ik −_ _gii,kk_

we shall get
_J = −αR + λ._ (∗)


-----

y y
such that x coincides with the first co-ordinate axis, and y with
the (1, 2)th co-ordinate plane, thus;

_x = (x1, 0, 0, . . ., 0),_ _y = (y1, y2, 0, . . ., 0),_
Λ = x[2]1[(][ay]1[2] [+ 2][by][1][y][2] [+][ cy]2[2][)][,]

whereby the sense of the second co-ordinate axis may yet be chosen
arbitrarily. Since Λ may not depend on this choice, we must have
_b = 0, therefore_

Λ = cx[2]1[(][y]1[2] [+][ y]2[2][) + (][a][ −] _[c][)(][x][1][y][1][)][2][ =][ c][(][x, x][)(][y, y][) + (][a][ −]_ _[c][)(][x, y][)][2][.]_

Proof of II: From the Λ = Λx which are given under I, we
derive the forms

Λx,x′ = α(x, x[′])(y, y) − _β(x, y)(x[′], y),_
Λy = (α − _β)(x, y)(y, y)._

If Λy is to vanish then α must equal β.
We have tacitly assumed that the metrical groundform of Riemann’s space is definitely positive; in case of a different index of
inertia a slight modification is necessary in the “Proof of I”. In
order that the second derivatives be excluded from the volume
integral J by means of partial integration, it is necessary that
the λik,rs’s depend only on the gik’s and not on their derivatives;
we did not, however, require this fact at all in our proof. Concerning the physical meaning entailed by the possibility, expressed
in (∗), of adding to a multiple of R also a universal constant λ,
we refer to § 34 Concerning the theorem here proved cf Vermeil

INTRODUCTION AND CHAPTER I

Note 1. (7) The detailed development of these ideas follows
very closely the lines of Husserl in his “Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie” (Jahrbuch f. Philos.
u. phänomenol. Forschung, Bd. 1, Halle, 1913).

Note 2. (21) Helmholtz in his dissertation, “Über die Tatsachen,
welche der Geometrie zugrunde liegen” (Nachr. d. K. Gesellschaft
d. Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, math.-physik. Kl., 1868), was the
first to attempt to found geometry on the properties of the group of
motions. This “Helmholtz space-problem” was defined more sharply
and solved by S. Lie (Berichte d. K. Sachs. Ges. d. Wissenschaften zu
Leipzig, math.-phys. Kl., 1890) by means of the theory of transformation groups, which was created by Lie (cf. Lie-Engel, Theorie der
Transformationsgruppen, Bd. 3, Abt. 5). Hilbert then introduced great
restrictions among the assumptions made by applying the ideas of the
theory of aggregates (Hilbert, Grundlagen der Geometrie, 3 Aufl.,
Leipzig, 1909, Anhang IV).

Note 3. (27) The systematic treatment of affine geometry not limited to the dimensional number 3 as well as of the whole subject of the
geometrical calculus is contained in the epoch-making work of Grassmann, Lineale Ausdehnungslehre (Leipzig, 1844). In forming the conception of a manifold of more than three dimensions, Grassmann as
well as Riemann was influenced by the philosophic ideas of Herbart.

Note 4. (78) The systematic form which we have here given to
the tensor calculus is derived essentially from Ricci and Levi-Civita:

form in the dissertation by Weyl, Reine Infinitesimalgeometrie, Math.
Zeitschrift, Bd. 2 (1918).

Note 10. (166) The conception of parallel displacement of a vector was set up for Riemann’s geometry in the dissertation quoted in
Note 9; to derive it, however, Levi-Civita assumed that Riemann’s
space is embedded in a Euclidean space of higher dimensions. A direct
explanation of the conception was given by Weyl in the first edition
of this book with the help of the geodetic co-ordinate system; it was
elevated to the rank of a fundamental axiomatic conception, which is
characteristic of the degree of the affine geometry, in the paper “Reine
Infinitesimalgeometrie,” mentioned in Note 9.

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
1.F.
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ’AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
The Foundation’s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations. Its business office is located at 809

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
   www.gutenberg.org
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
